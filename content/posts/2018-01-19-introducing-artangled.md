Artangled is a bare-bones blog about art shows that lead to connections. It's written by [Joseph Clift](https://josephclift.com).

Which connections? As an untrained but enthusiastic observer, I try to connect what I'm looking at to what I've seen, experienced or felt at another time.

(Sometimes, I'll get tangled.)
