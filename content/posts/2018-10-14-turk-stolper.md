I saw this exhibition, [subtitled 'A Brexit portfolio and other Transit Disasters'](http://www.paulstolper.com/artists/portfolio/200-gavin-turk-transit-disasters-2018) at a time when the thoroughly depressing Brexit negotiations were reaching something of a climax.

The central motif of the various silkscreen prints is a burnt out Ford Transit. Any British observer would recognise the cultural signifier of a white van - home to "White Van Man", a highly Brexity demographic.

The prints themselves owe an obvious debt to Warhol's gloomy 60s prints of car crashes. Though their surface is sprinkled with diamond dusk, a signature of Turk's.

I always really loved the Warhol prints, along with his spectacularly sinister silkscreens of electric chairs. Turk's tribute is deliberately more hum-drum and low-stakes; a few of the prints show impassive onlookers walking past the burnt-out vehicle without even looking at it.

Transit vans like these, the (excellent) show notes point out, are driven by men who deliver goods "in a post high street Britain where global logistics have become intertwined with his paranoid fear of being taken advantage of by bureaucrats and by migrating foreigners".

The eerie pre-crash atmosphere of the present day in London lifts and animates this show.

### Other highlights

This week I also checked out [A New Spirit Then, A New Spirit Now](https://www.alminerech.com/exhibitions/5137-a-new-spirit-then-a-new-spirit-now-1981-2018) at Almine Rech, a tribute to the RA's classic *A New Spirit in Painting* show, featuring a welcome work from my beloved AR Penck. I'm still baffled by Georg Baselitz's crude, inverted portraits, and [A Focus on the 80s, his show at Thaddeus Ropac](https://www.ropac.net/exhibition/a-focus-on-the-1980s-1) didn't help.

Joan Jonas's fey and daffy [In the Trees II video installation](https://amandawilkinsongallery.com/exhibitions/112/overview/) is on at Amanda Wilkinson, and I enjoyed her delicate bird paintings. I was totally baffled by [Maggie Lee: Music Videos](http://arcadiamissa.com/maggie-lee/) at Arcadia Missa, though to be honest I always love walking up that grotty timewarp Soho staircase to the gallery.

The [Lord Duveen tribute show at Lévy Gorvy](https://www.levygorvy.com/exhibitions/lord-duveen-my-pictures-never-look-so-marvellous-as-when-you-are-here/) was a balls-out blockbuster even by that flashy place's standards, pairing mid 20th century furniture with A-list artworks - a Klein sponge here, a Calder mobile there.

Elsewhere, I saw Sean Scully's calming oil on aluminium horizontal band paintings - such a luxurious sheen! - [at Blain Southern](https://www.blainsouthern.com/exhibitions/sean-scully-uninsideout/), and Tatiana Trouvé's Navigation Map installation at [Kamel Mennour](http://www.kamelmennour.com/media/10764/tatiana-trouve-prepared-space-navigation-map-london-2018.html).
