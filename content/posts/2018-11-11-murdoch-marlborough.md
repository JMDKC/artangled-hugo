Nina Murdoch paints with egg tempera on gesso. Her works main show abstracted scenes of buildings and pathways. Some of the paintings [in this show](http://www.marlboroughlondon.com/exhibitions/nina-murdoch-collecting-colour/), with their endless layerings and scrapings, take years to produce.

To me, they had the irresistably evocative atmosphere of a rainy London evening - evocative maybe because that was exactly the atmosphere outside of the gallery, when I wandered in ten minutes before closing. *Path*, pictured below, which took three years, drew me in, with its lights banding as if they were seen from a slow-moving car.

She's said to work in "abstract Baroque", whatever that means. Maybe it refers to the depth of craft necessary to create these pools of shining orangey-yellow light that puncture the murk, just like an old, pre-LCD streetlight. Maybe it's their appeal to the infinite and the unknown. Or maybe it's their slightly stately grandeur.

Looking closely, I tried to discern architectural details in the paintings, and the mini-replicas in pastels at the back of the gallery. In the end, I gave up and enjoyed them from a distance, as I was supposed to.

### Other highlights

I also saw [Adam Pendleton: Our Ideas](https://www.pacegallery.com/exhibitions/12958/our-ideas) at PACE	London, where I was pretty baffled by the artist's idea of "Black Dada". I was actively annoyed by [Mario Schifano: Compagni, compagni, 1968](https://www.mayorgallery.com/m/exhibitions/535/overview/) at The Mayor Gallery, with spray paint on perspex prints depicting hammer-and-sickle wielding protesters (each going for at least £180k). There's more 60s Italy at [Pietro Consagra: Frontal Sculptures 1947-67](https://www.robilantvoena.com/exhibitions/185/) from Robilant & Voena, the welded aluminium disks hanging from the ceiling totally evocative of that decade. I could imagine one on David Hemmings' wall in *Blow-Up*.

I caught the last day of the [Zeng Fanzhi show at Hauser & Wirth](https://www.hauserwirth.com/hauser-wirth-exhibitions/19622-zeng-fanzhi-london) - and was glad I did, considering the artist's amazing mastery of colour and form. (Best work was his reproductions of Victor Hugo's deathmask, against absolutely raw canvas.) [Klimt/Schiele at the Royal Academy](https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibition/klimt-schiele) was a logistical challenge more than anything else as it was so packed, but it was a seriously high-wattage collection of drawings from the pair of Austrian bad boys. Maybe a bit too bad in places, such as the livid red labia of one of Schiele's clearly underage subjects.

Michael Landy is showing compacted cubes of previous artworks [at Thomas Dane Gallery](https://www.thomasdanegallery.com/artists/43-michael-landy/exhibitions/), while I was introduced by Léon Wuidar's [uber-precise, Brutalist architecture-inspired paintings](https://whitecube.com/exhibitions/exhibition/leon_wuidar_inside_the_white_cube_2018) at White Cube.
