Zoe Leonard is an American conceptual artist who took aerial photos of New York City over several years in the late 80s. Gelatin silver prints of these [are on show as Hauser & Wirth](https://www.hauserwirth.com/hauser-wirth-exhibitions/22454-zoe-leonard) right now, and when I went to see them, I basically wanted to buy them all, in an alternative fantasy universe where I actually have the funds to do that.

The artist’s eye gets caught on urban infrastructure; the densely gridded street pattern of the city; worn summer baseball fields, packed back to back and encroached on by houses from all sides; and, most lovingly shot of all, a gleaming rail interchange, the iron and wood of the parallel tracks caught by low light, rendered mysterious by the silver print’s blur. I looked at this wonderful, inscrutable photograph, untitled like most of the others in the show, for a long time.

Elsewhere, there are a couple of less interesting nature shots: a meander of a river, shot twice, each time abstracted by a slight motion blur.

Leonard isn’t trying to be polemical, or impose any humanity on the man-made urban landscapes she depicts. (A tension I’ve noticed in other artists featured here previously, such as [Andreas Gursky](http://artangled.com/2018/02/25/gursky-hayward/) and [Mario Sironi](http://artangled.com/2018/02/18/sironi-estorick/).) But even so, I was moved by the serenity of her literally elevated perspective: the urban realm, grimy and messy at ground level, revealing hidden patterns and symmetries when shot from a great height.

### Other Highlights

[Condo 2019](http://www.condocomplex.org/london/) opened this week in London, and I visited its Cork Street Galleries hub: standouts for me there were Dickon Drury’s gaudy Dutch landscapes and Gili Tal’s fun pretend office doormats.

![Lorenzato](/leonard-hauser-wirth-2.jpg)

Amadeo Luciano Lorenzato is a new name for me, but the Brazilian artist’s [exhibition at David Zwirner](https://www.davidzwirner.com/exhibitions/amadeo-luciano-lorenzato), the first outside his native country, was quite lovely. It features gem-like, and very small, oil on board paintings - using similar techniques to early Renaissance greats Cimabue and Masaccio, who inspired Lorenzato - but this time depicting landscapes of scenes from his home town, Belo Horizonte.

A couple of crowd-pleasers next. [Chiharu Shiota: Me Somewhere Else](https://www.blainsouthern.com/exhibitions/me-somewhere-else) makes complex, precisely-patterned yarn works, and there’s a spectacular room-sized one at Blain Southern. Meanwhile, Martin Creed is making [many, many visual jokes at Hauser & Wirth](https://www.hauserwirth.com/hauser-wirth-exhibitions/22509-martin-creed-toast).

Also at Blain Southern, there’s some [uncanny pencil portraits from Jonas Burgert](https://www.blainsouthern.com/exhibitions/schlagen-und-bleiben), while his compatriot David Ostrowski has [a show organised around the colour red](http://www.spruethmagers.com/exhibitions/485) at Spreuth Magers.

I really enjoyed Jedd Novatt’s stainless steel *Chaos* sculptures of various sizes - kind of like frameworks of under-construction skyscrapers - [at Waddington Custot](https://www.waddingtoncustot.com/exhibitions/122/), while [Todd Bienvenu at Almine Rech](https://www.alminerech.com/exhibitions/5353-todd-bienvenu) had the funniest show notes: the American painter’s deliberately crude acrylic on canvas paintings of bikinis, bike crashes and swimming pools could definitely be summed up as “hungover Hockney”.

Bienvenu reminded me a lot of Eric Fischl, and kudos to him for giving us two painted explorations of a very modern light source: people’s faces being lit up by their phone screens in the dark.

Finally, if you ever wanted to find out what Godard’s *Le mépris* looks like with Brigitte Bardot digitally removed, you can find out in [Amie Siegel’s show at Thomas Dane](https://www.thomasdanegallery.com/exhibitions/213/works/), which features exactly that video work. I also found out there that the 1963 movie had an alternative soundtrack for the Italian market. It’s an absurd, pornified counterpoint to Georges Delerue’s famous tune for the rest-of-world version.
