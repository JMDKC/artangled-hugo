Alexander Calder and Joan Miró were good friends, with a lot in common. The same goes for the work, too, and [this dreamy little exhibition](http://nahmadprojects.com/exhibition/calder-miro-clair-de-lune/) proves it. Working in Paris, both took the most crowd-pleasing bits of the Surrealist movement they were surrounded with, and expressed it in antic, zany, colourful form. Calder made mobiles, Miró paintings.

They’re both still really popular: the last couple of years having brought major retrospectives for Calder at the Whitney, and Miró at the Grand Palais. The show at Nahmad Projects, a tiny fortress-like space in Mayfair, is, necessarily, much tighter.

It’s structured by two pairs, one small and one large. Pictured above is Calder’s *Red Stalk* (1955) and a little Miró oil, *Chien enragé*, from the same year.

The larger pair is from 1964: *Blue and Yellow among Reds* from Calder and *Oiseau dans la nuit* from Miró. Calder’s mobile is hanging temptingly above head height: it was made in the same year as his first big Guggenheim retrospective.

A particularly happy moment for a particularly happy artist. This show made me smile.

*Calder/Miro: Clair de lune is at Nahmad Projects (London).  22 February – 18 April 2019*
