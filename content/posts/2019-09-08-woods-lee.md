This artist’s practice has similar roots to other artists I’ve featured on this site before. [Like Robert Muntean](http://artangled.com/2019/01/27/muntean-rosenfeld/), Clare Woods [takes found images from newspapers and magazines](https://www.simonleegallery.com/exhibitions/168/) and makes something new with them.

Like her compatriot Gary Hume, she paints on aluminium, giving the final works an ultra-clean, shiny, textured look. [Like Rachel Howard](http://artangled.com/2018/03/04/howard-newport/) , she paints from above, letting the drips fall down the edges of the works.

But Woods’ overall effects are unique. Look at *It’s the end of the World as we know it*, in which her simple oil paint strokes efficiently reproduce the texture of glass, water, petals and damp wood, while at the same time letting the flat, hard, metal base render the entire image strange and otherworldly.

The fact that Woods was previously a sculptor came as a surprise to me, considering her paintings do so much with flatness. Maybe the extreme two-dimensionality of the works are a reaction against this previous life.

Other paintings, especially *Doublethink*, a large triptych in Simon Lee’s basement gallery, push towards abstraction, straining away from the found image. The painterly effect is similarly impressive, though.
