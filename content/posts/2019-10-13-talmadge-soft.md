I read the [original New York Magazine exposé of Anna Delvey](https://www.thecut.com/2018/05/how-anna-delvey-tricked-new-york.html), the mysteriously-accented genius grifter, in bed one Saturday morning, phone a couple of inches from my riveted eyes, too fascinated to even reach over to my bedside table for my glasses.

While that was fun for a morning read, plus a few days of Twitter hilarity, I have to say I’m surprised that Delvey’s impact on the culture means she’s now the subject of a London exhibition viewed by thousands of people a day. That headline number’s a (not quite Delvey-level) trick though, as the gallery’s [Soft Opening](http://www.softopening.london/), the vitrine just inside one of the eastern exits of Piccadilly Circus tube station that I’ve [featured previously on this site](http://artangled.com/2018/09/16/delmar-soft/).

Despite the show’s title, its artist, Cynthia Talmadge, was inspired by a lot more than Delvey’s eye-catching court appearances. Fans of the original article will spot a matchbook from the Moroccan resort hotel that forms a key setpiece for one of the larger scams. Elsewhere, there’s a shopping bag, a courthouse building and a pair of theatrical masks: accessories of a deception. The wooden screen onto which these blue designs are painted seems like just another way of obscuring things.

Though despite my repeated visits (as a regular commuter) I’ve missed what apparently is [the main action](https://www.thedailybeast.com/anna-delvey-soho-grifter-becomes-art-world-muse-in-new-installation-about-courtroom-fashion-12) in the exhibition: every now and then a Delvey outfit is mechanically whipped in front of the screen, then back again.

Though seeing this exhibition *did* inspire me to revisit that jawdropping original article, so I’m pretty happy. A bit happier than Delvey too - despite her fame, which extends beyond this show and to an [upcoming Netflix series](https://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/a29667668/anna-delvey-tv-series-shonda-rhimes-news-cast-date-spoilers/), she was convicted of attempted grand larceny, among other charges, earlier this year and is currently in prison.
