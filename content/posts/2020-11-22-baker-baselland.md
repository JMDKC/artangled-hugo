I can’t find much about the Zurich-based artist Brigham Baker on the internet, beyond a [nice Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/brighambaker/?hl=en). But when I emptied my mind and allowed some gallery memories to drift in (aka, the start of composing one of these lockdown posts), I thought about his beehives.

I saw them at Kunsthaus Baselland, as part of *Beehave*, a [group show celebrating the honeybee](https://kunsthausbaselland.ch/en/ausstellungen/beehave) - which was a lot less cutesy than it sounds, considering many of the artists used the animal as a symbolic harbinger of climate change, war and so on.

Baker’s contribution was pictured above - elegant blocks of hive honey on spindly steel frames. As elegant as a Mondrian, lit from behind like stained glass windows in a church. The work linked in my head with a Miró sculpture in the next room - *Girl with a bee’s nest hat*, in that it focussed on the bee’s prime aesthetic contribution to the natural world: those gorgeous interlocking hexagonal honeycomb patterns.

Looking closer at the hives, the honeycomb was lit up in different colours from the sun - a simple but gorgeous effect. (The exhibition was created in cooperation with the Fundació Joan Miró in Barcelona.)

Anyway, my notes from the show, seen a couple of years ago now, suggest that other works featured photographs of dead bees, and a room downstairs where the viewer was encouraged to walk across honeycomb patterns on the floor while listening to techno music on their headphones. I don’t remember that at all - but for some reason, these elegant steel structures are on my mind today.

*Beehave was at Kunsthaus Baselland (Basel). 14 September - 11 November 2018*
