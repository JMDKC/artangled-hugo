This artist is the subject of much critical sniffiness, thanks to his works generally being so open and people pleasing. His vinyl cuts and sculptures adorn many a public square (and the odd album cover), to general acclaim. His [current show at Lisson Gallery’s Mayfair outpost](https://www.lissongallery.com/exhibitions/julian-opie-547dc9ae-cab6-4d9a-8633-e45b7eff2b60) is typically cute and arresting.

There are two main subjects, generally in painted metal: group scenes of crowds walking down the street, and brightly-coloured tower blocks. Opie’s figures, as always, are radically simplified. This means that we can’t really tell if they’re wearing masks; though it’s quite nice at this stage of the pandemic to see that they aren’t social distancing. Perhaps Opie’s carefree, extrovert style is a poor match for a world marked by COVID, so he’s showing us a scene from the before times.

I loved the aluminium tower blocks, too. A collection of four is stacked against the wall for *Apartments 1*, overlapping each other slightly, a pristine and orderly urban scene. Opie clearly has affection for people, streets, the city, which made me think of Prunella Clough, [that other London artist I featured last week](/posts/clough-annely), who was attracted to grimy and forgotten urban corners.

The two artists work in the same city, but highlight different aspects of the same place: Opie’s big metal works show business and order; Clough’s small paintings are the exact opposite.

When I left the gallery there was a final surprise, which for some reason I hadn’t noticed on my way in. The full-height windows are overlaid with more of Opie’s tower blocks, this time built out of vinyl decals. So cute!
