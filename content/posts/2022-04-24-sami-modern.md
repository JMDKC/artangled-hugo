*The Execution Room*, painted by Mohammed Sami, is one of the most impressively ugly artworks I’ve seen in a while. It’s [currently on show at Modern Art](https://modernart.net/exhibitions/mohammed-sami), along with a collection of other new, thematically-linked work from this Iraq-born, Sweden-based artist.

It shows a dining table and chair set in a style that might kindly be termed “dictator chic”. I suspect, but can’t confirm by googling, that it was a room in Saddam Hussein’s palace, captured by allied forces during the disastrous war of 2003. The chintzy chair-backs, shiny table-top and plush patterned carpet are bathed in yellow electric light (the chandelier peeking from the top like the light bulb in Picasso’s *Guernica*).

But it’s the backdrop that gives the scene a dream like - nightmare-like? - quality. The walls of the room, the curtains, the mirror reflecting the light, are all barely painted in, compared to the carefully-worked textures of the furnishings. They’re bathed in a flat vanilla shade, though part of the wall is underlaid with flatter beiges and greys, the exact colour of a bruise.

At this table, on these grotesque chairs, the dictator dealt death. Other works in the exhibition carry through this atmosphere of dread: rolls of Middle Eastern carpets look like piles of flesh (*Skin*), a spray-canned shadow of a heroic statue is cast on a baked yellow brick background (*Statue)*, and pillars of fire burn in the desert (*The Fountain*).

Sami’s memories of the old country are showcased most obviously in *Abu Ghraib*, when the iconic photo of the tortured prisoner in crucifix pose (a [repeated motif for artists these days](/posts/howard-newport)) is rendered abstract by a mix of acrylic paints and spray can, reduced to a single shape, that somehow is immediately recognisable due to the infamy of the source material.

All in all, an intensely unsettling exhibition.
