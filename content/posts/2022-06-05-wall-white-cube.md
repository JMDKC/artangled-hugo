Jeff Wall’s best known for large, lush, elaborately staged photographs set in light boxes. This [absorbing exhibition](https://whitecube.com/exhibitions/exhibition/Jeff_Wall_White_Cube_Masons_Yard_2022) puts on show several of his unstaged and landscape works - all of which are blown up to a grand scale. The show’s at the large White Cube gallery in Mayfair was eerily deserted when I visited, with most other commercial galleries closed due to the Jubilee weekend.

Quite appropriately, the standout exhibit depicts a party - though not one you’d want to be at. It’s called *Event*, from 2020, and depicts two men in a heated argument. Both are in tuxedos. One leans forward, jabbing his finger into the other’s chest. The other leans back, passively, but with an unreadable expression. Perhaps with a flicker of contempt in his downcast eyes.

I don’t know where it was taken - my best guess is Los Angeles, where the Canadian artist now lives and works. I don’t know the occasion: at a guess, a wedding? Maybe from the city’s big (and wealthy) Persian community? I don’t even know if the picture was staged or unstaged: if the latter, Wall got spectacularly lucky with the composition and lighting, so of course I suspect the former.

The documentary details are fascinating: the scuffed wood, the garish carpet, the tacky gilt doorframes. The slightly too-big jacket on the smaller man. The sheen of their carefully-polished leather shoes. Just like Wall’s contemporary Andreas Gursky, [on show at another White Cube gallery across town](https://whitecube.com/exhibitions/exhibition/andreas_gursky_white_cube_bermondsey_2022), the subject of the work is rendered all the more noticeable, the more epic, the more dramatic, by the large scale: the print is 2.2 metres tall.

No lightbox needed this time - the human drama illuminates this captured moment. A great artist.
