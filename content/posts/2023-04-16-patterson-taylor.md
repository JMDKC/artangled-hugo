Richard Patterson was a YBA, part of the scandalous 1990s [‘Sensation’ generation](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m001cbsr). But, like his peers [Gillian Wearing](/tags/gillian-wearing) and [Gavin Turk](/tags/gavin-turk), he’s matured into a painter of sensitivity and skill. Proof of this view comes in ‘[Only Fans](https://www.timothytaylor.com/exhibitions/richard-patterson_2023/)’, a show of small-format works using what the press release describes as a “carnal palette”, which closed this week at Timothy Taylor.

All 13 paintings in the exhibition are dreamy swirls of flesh-toned roses and ochres, on luxurious-looking linen canvas. They’re somehow deeply textured and flat at the same time, an optical illusion that comes from Patterson using a wet-on-wet technique: painting a layer of different-coloured oil paint while the previous layer is still wet.

Step back, and in many of the works you can just about make out the shadowy form of a lounging woman - sometimes her face, sometimes her curvaceous butt. 'Delaunay' (2022), pictured above, is a good example. The exhibition’s title, the name of a pay-for-porn website, helps us make sense of what we're seeing: naked flesh, mediated by layers of digital-looking distortion. An illusion of intimacy.

Tricksy representations of online porn are employed quite a bit by artists these days - I’m thinking in particular of a [Wade Guyton show](https://www.crousel.com/en/article/wade-guyton-natural-wine-2019/) I saw a couple of years back, that made sly use of inkjet prints from XVideos (OnlyFans for the hard-up).

But while Guyton went for the shock factor, there’s nothing explicit about Patterson’s work, really. In fact, it’s their withholding nature that makes these small, lush, fleshy paintings so memorable.

*Richard Patterson: Only Fans is at Timothy Taylor (London). 11 March - 15 April 2023*
