Until seeing [this show](https://www.bombfactory.org.uk/post/all-things-fall-by-mat-collishaw-the-bomb-factory-marylebone) by chance yesterday, I admit that I was totally unfamiliar with Mat Collishaw’s work. I only knew him as [Tracey Emin](/tags/tracey-emin)’s fellow-YBA ex. But if these delightful spectacles are representative of what he does generally, I'm well up for seeing more.

*All Things Fall* is a people pleasing mix of paintings on raw linen, animatronic animals and a zoetrope. Despite the show notes describing Collishaw’s art as “dark”, nothing’s actually disturbing here. The children with parents wandering through the gallery, drawn in by its super-prominent corner location on Euston Road and Baker Street, who were clearly having a whale of a time.

I’m sure the younger visitors got more out of it than more serious adults who actually read the press release and notes, actually. The fact is that a big metal robot stag that occasionally stamps its foot (*Insilico*) looks really cool. The cool factor diminishes a bit when you read that the stamping is powered by algorithmic analysis of mean posts on Twitter. 

Similarly, the gorgeous white-on-raw-linen paintings of motion-blurred deers and other animals (the *Palantir* series from 2022) are best enjoyed without having read [Collishaw’s explanation](https://worldart.news/2023/03/23/the-bomb-factory-art-foundation-presents-mat-collishaws-latest-series-of-works-including-sentiment-analysis-animatronic-sculptures-optical-illusions-and-paintings/) that they were inspired by the “primal herd instinct” of social media, and are “a shadowy record of the predator and its prey”.

I deliberately didn’t look up exactly *what* was the doubtless deeply prosaic inspiration behind *All Things Fall*, the sculpture of a heavily-populated classical temple-like structure that lends the exhibition its name. It’s a zoetrope - when it spins, it becomes animated. 

I was thoroughly taken by the little animated muscle men who started to beat each other up, floor strewn with bodies of the fallen, as the zoetrope span. 

I’m sure it was a comment on capitalistic digital surveillance or whatever, but the fact remains, it looked really cool - and I posted a story about it on Instagram with a clear conscience.
