I’ve featured the Mexican artist Gabriel de la Mora on here before, [when I visited his show at Perrotin](https://artangled.com/posts/de-la-mora-perrotin/) in Paris in 2019. Then as now, I was impressed by his “craft and obsession”. In Paris, I saw works in which he used shoe soles and eggshells, layered up and tesselated, to make semi-abstract patterns.

The eggshells are back, [here at Timothy Taylor in London](https://www.timothytaylor.com/exhibitions/fragmentxs/), and are joined by works made from tiny blown-glass mirrors and, most arrestingly of all, butterfly wings, painted over in acrylic but not to the extent that they lose their uncanny, alien-like iridescent shimmer. In each of this series of work, de la Mora arranges the wings into a circular form on a different-coloured, square format background. They suggested to me a rising sun, or maybe a *****nazar*****, an evil eye pendant that wards off hostile glances.

Not that I’d ever give one of those to this artist’s works: I’m a fan, and my fandom only deepened in this show. Timothy Taylor tends to put a standout work above the fireplace on its first floor gallery, in prime spot next to the window. So it is here, with *1,984 He.Le*, pictured above. 

Hebomoia leucippe is an Indonesian species, whose males have striking two tone wings: orange on the top, yellow on the bottom. In this stunning work, de la Mora separates the two, suggesting a smoggy yellow sun on a fiery background, a mini-golden hour that blazes and shimmers out at us from the wall.

The painstaking, obsessive meticulousness that would be required to create such a work takes nothing away from its quicksilver sublimity, the instant transportation we as a viewer get just by looking at it. de la Mora’s considerable skill is to pull off this subtle artistic trick, again and again.

*Gabriel de la Mora: Fragmentxs is at Timothy Taylor (London). 31 August - 30 September 2023*
