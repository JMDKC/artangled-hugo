The most shocking thing about Sarah Lucas’ [Tate Britain retrospective](https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/sarah-lucas) is the news, contained in the show notes, that she’s 60 years old. There’s something of the eternal bolshy teenager in this artist - in her eyeroll-inducing earnestness and sledgehammer literal-mindedness on one hand, but, on the other, in her vim and vigour, her sincerity and charm.

My favourite of the show’s four rooms was the parade of *Bunnies,* which Lucas has been making since the 1990s. “It turns out, surprisingly you may think, that a saggy tit is very expressive,” the artist says. Mainly using tights filled with stuffing, these soft sculptures wind and flop over and around chairs, clad in skyscraping high heels.

Lucas owes an obvious debt to pioneering feminist artists like [Louise Bourgeois](https://artangled.com/tags/louise-bourgeois/), as well as her fellow Brit Art *enfants terribles* turned *grandes dames* [Tracey Emin](https://artangled.com/tags/tracey-emin/) and [Gillian Wearing](https://artangled.com/tags/gillian-wearing/). But there’s something unique about her off-kilter view of sexuality and the body. Her art is fearless, just like a teenager is fearless.

The same can’t be said for the Tate curators, who put these fragile soft sculptures behind a rope with at least six feet of leeway between them and the exhibition-going crowds. It’s a shame - all the more so given that the *Bunnies*, as objects, are so charming and interesting. We all smiled in this room, like we’d just been huffing some happy gas. We want to get closer, but can’t.

Anyway, that safety-first attitude couldn’t be further away from the kind of thing Lucas is driving at with her art, of course.
