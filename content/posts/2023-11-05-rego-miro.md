Around a year ago, I wrote about [a very affecting Victor Willing show](https://artangled.com/posts/willing-taylor/). He was a painter of some extraordinarily claustrophobic scenes, produced in the 1970s and 1980s in a windowless East London studio, while the artist was suffering from worsening multiple sclerosis symptoms. At the time, Willing was married to Paula Rego, then and now a much better-known painter. On the evidence of [this exhibition](https://online.victoria-miro.com/paula-rego-london-2023/), her paintings of that time couldn’t have been more different: free, expansive and utterly confident of line, where Willing’s were constrained, tentative, introspective.

Animals, humans, and some hybrids of the two caper across Rego’s large paintings, a dozen or so are on show. Some on paper, some on canvas - they’re carefully composed but also somehow spontaneous. Loose, as the show’s title has it. Clearly produced quickly, fluidly, from the imagination.

One series dramatises opera performances (Rego used to accompany her dad to the Lisbon opera house as a child, before she moved to the UK to study). Another features girls roughhousing with some vicious-looking dogs. All are brightly coloured, with thick, matt brushstrokes. The lines are confident and sure. They teem with life.

Intriguingly, part of this 80s artistic flowering came was seeded in Rego’s personal burdens, which must have included her increasingly sick husband, painting his disturbing images in his studio. Some monstrous beasts lurked in her subconscious, but she had the strength and skill to render them in bright acrylic paint, make them into something new, freeing herself. It must have been especially satisfying for her that it was *****these***** works that really made her artistic name, both in the UK and abroad.

“I think it was only after my private life came back into the work that things began to get a bit better,” Rego, who died in 2022, once said. 

“It was like freedom again.”
