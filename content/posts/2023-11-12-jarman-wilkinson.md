I was very mean about the artist and filmmaker Derek Jarman’s “terrible” paintings when I last wrote about them, [having visited his show at the Garden Museum in 2020](https://artangled.com/posts/jarman-garden/). But this [new exhibition of his](https://website-amandawilkinson.artlogic.net/exhibitions/225-derek-jarman-queer/press_release_text/), at Amanda Wilkinson’s upstairs gallery in Farringdon, has made me rethink my view. The thick black impasto of Jarman's paintings, that I had nastily described as “lobotomised Auerbach”, now seems profoundly redolent of the artist’s rage and dread. These paintings still seem terrible to me, but in the sense that they *induce terror*.

Terror of death, of course. Jarman knew he was dying of AIDS when he painted the eight large canvases on show at Amanda Wilkinson: they’re all from 1992, and were originally shown at Manchester City Art Gallery that year. The artist himself had just over a year to live at that point.

Terror and rage: Jarman was incensed by the homophobia of Britain’s media, and composed each of the works on show by photocopying particularly inflammatory tabloid newspaper front pages - LESBIAN TEACHER HORROR, HE CALLED IT LOVE… BUT I CALL IT MURDER - and semi-obliterating them under his thick oil paints. Added to the mix are Jarman’s own words, carved out in the paint at surface level. My favourite work from the show, *Dead Angels*, is above. Only after looking closely can you make out in it the artist’s own words, in firework reds and yellows, on top of the blackness: *angel of death*.

Jarman himself described these paintings as having been produced with “no hope and wild laughter”. I completely missed his humour the first time round, but it’s hard to miss here, in the works’ cacophonous layering of hysterias: some societally generated and fired up by an unscrupulous press, some the artist’s own. You step back and you have to laugh, given the bleakness of the alternative.

I did get one thing right in my 2020 review, describing Jarman as “one of the very angriest artists” of recent times. It’s a terrible achievement that this anger can still be heard, and resonates loudly, within these walls, on a sunny early winter afternoon, forty years after his death.
