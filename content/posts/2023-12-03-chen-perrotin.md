I was talking to a colleague the other day, who mentioned she’d spend some time in Beijing over the Christmas break. Sounds nice, I said. It’s unbearably, unbearably cold, she responded. It was pretty cold in Paris, too, when I came across [this exhibition from Beijing-based artist Chen Ke](https://leaflet.perrotin.com/view/638/bauhaus-gal-theatre). Part of the magic of visual art is that sometimes, when viewing, you’re taken somewhere different; in this case, it was 100 years ago, around the opening of the Bauhaus school, with Fritz Lang’s **********Metropolis********** in cinemas, swooshy streamlined apartment buildings under construction, and avant garde furniture behind gleaming plate-glass shopfronts.

Chen’s warmly-hued, smoothly worked paintings feature all of this: Maria the robot, the Barcelona chair and that legendary rectilinear building in Dessau. The ‘gals’ of the show’s title, beautiful, impassive-looking young women with bobbed hair and cool knitwear were taken from archive photographs of female Bauhaus students, in a Taschen book owned by the artist.

In other words, these slightly fantastical images are objects of pure fantasy, from an artist who has always worked in a different continent and time, produced in a studio in a city that gets bitterly cold in winter. The bravery and determination of the 1920s gals must be reflected, in some way, in their creator: that she had a fantasy, and dared to solidify it on canvas, for others to look at. 

Chen originally called this show ********Utopia,******** before reconsidering. Life was no picnic for a woman going to university in the 1920s, regardless of how cool they looked. Adding a single word, *********Theatre,********* underlines the change from hope to cynical distance.

I personally think she should have stuck with ******Utopia******. These fantasy gals, lit up in unreal colours, surrounded by beautiful objects and symbols of go-ahead modernity, don’t seem deserving of being encumbered by reality. Certainly, as I looked at them, I felt the chill of the winter day seeping away. I bet she felt the same when she painted them, on the other side of the world, in another century…
