I’ve [long been a fan](https://artangled.com/posts/steggles-beecroft/) of the painter Jock McFadyen, a self-described abstract artist whose scenes are nevertheless piercingly familiar - showing as they do London's grit, grot and light. Recently he’s been opening up temporary exhibitions in the building that houses his studio in east London, the latest of which is [a joint show with musician Jem Finer](https://www.thegreygallery.com/news.html).

Finer, a founder member of rock group The Pogues, originally composed a soundtrack for the show that was partly recorded from the London Underground. It featured the announcements and signal sounds that form part of the ambience of any London commuter’s life. These sounds would have closely reflected what was shown in the paintings: a series painted by McFadyen in the 1990s, depicting various tube stations.

*Aldgate East*, above, is a wonderful example: the grandeur of the generous staircase offset by the pitiless artificial lighting; the elegance of the trellis gate next to the murkiness of the tunnel. Rendering a place that local residents (myself included) have passed through thousands of times somehow separate.

Finer’s original soundtrack was junked and replaced when news came, a couple of weeks ago, [of Pogues frontman Shane MacGowan’s death.](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-67523427) Now, the mechanical whirrs and groans that ring through the gallery, that we hear as we look at McFadyen’s lovingly depicted station walls, stairs and signage, form a sort of requiem. It lends epicness to these familiar scenes: that these tunnels connect a vast infrastructure, miraculously transporting thousands of people to where they need to be, even if we don’t appreciate the miracle and barely notice what’s around us.

Or it's a reflection of private grief, when in fact, the trains, and the tiled rooms where they rest, for a few seconds, remain impassive or indifferent. Then we roll on to the next station. Unless we stop, and look, and listen.
