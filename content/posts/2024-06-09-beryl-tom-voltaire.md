The fact that this exhibition is [made in partnership](https://studiovoltaire.org/whats-on/beryl-cook-and-tom-of-finland/) with Tom’s foundation and Beryl’s family, shows a stark distance between these two artists. Tom of Finland exiled himself to the sunny west coast of the USA, found a family of leather-clad hunks, and achieved a lasting posthumous reputation. Beryl Cook stayed at home in less-sunny Plymouth, kept herself to herself, and while finding lasting commercial success, won’t ever get anything as grand as her own foundation. The two artists never met, and there’s no indication they were even aware of the other’s work.

But enough about the differences. I get that some people will see this bringing together of totally different artists as a curatorial contrivance - and have an aversion to exhibitions of this kind as a result. But I think this show convincingly shows that the two artists, separated by geography, social conditions and reputation, were kindred spirits in practically everything else.

They were both fantasists, and observers rather than doers. They cast an adoring, non-judgmental eye on other people’s pleasure. Pleasure was the energy generator of their artistic output: whether it’s Tom’s wildly well-hung leather hunks enjoying an outdoor orgy, or Beryl’s bulbous broads on a riotous girl’s night out.

Their working methods were strikingly similar, too. Up from Plymouth, Beryl Cook used to scour phone boxes in London to collect calling cards from local hookers. She took sneaky reference photos, dividing them into undated albums with names like “bodies”, “pubs, clubs + rest”. At home, she plotted out the exact colours and compositions of her paintings in meticulous pencil sketches. Don’t be fooled by the crudeness of the final works, or the fact she can’t paint anatomically convincing hands and feet: she was in charge, throughout.

Meanwhile in California, Tom was a scrap booker, sifting through and cutting out photos from magazines, compiling them on mood boards, then synthesising them into his final pencil drawings. (The anatomical impossibilities of which extend past hands and feet.)

The thing this exhibition brought home to me was that both artists were, ultimately, shut-ins. That the pleasure they put on show is the pleasure of others. That, at the end of the day, they aren’t too bothered by that; given they have the more recondite pleasure of the voyeur.

This was brought home by the exhibition’s references to Edward Burra, a painter with a similar artistic viewpoint that [I’ve frequently featured on here](https://artangled.com/tags/edward-burra/) who the curators mention as a key influence on Beryl Cook. He was a still more extreme shut-in, bed bound, but still dreaming of the dockside café, the local scantily-clad prostitute, the parties happening elsewhere.

All of these artist know that there are parties happening elsewhere; that they might be on the periphery; but that there’s another kind pleasure in looking.
