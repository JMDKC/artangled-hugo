Hannah Levy’s glass, steel and silicone sculptures seem like pretty much the most impractical things in the world. Eight, specially designed for the space, [are on show at MASSIMODECARLO right now](https://massimodecarlo.com/exhibitions/hannah-levy).

Levy calls them “strange, furniture-like creatures”. The orange and red glass and silicone are bulbously biomorphic, slightly constrained by the exoskeleton-like metal. And so, slight bulges appear. The sculptures are in the form of furniture: chairs and light fittings. Though in their spindly fragility they could hardly be less in line with the old modernist principle of form following function.

Levy added a carpet to the gallery’s floor, giving more of a plush atmosphere, but also allowing her to fix her impossibly wobbly forms to something, discreetly, so they don't fall over. In each room, her lamp-like, wall-mounted glass works strain outwards, the bulbous heads encased in metal claws, trying to get a better look at us.

In a video accompanying the show, the artist adds that her inspirations ranged from the Art Noveau to photos of insects (the chair legs, looked at again, are very bug-like). It’s an arresting collection, grabbing our attention as surely as steel grips glass.
