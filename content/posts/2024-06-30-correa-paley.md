I need to stop writing about pretty, decorative, but ultimately unchallenging art. It’s not really what I should go to galleries for.

I’m breaking my own rule, then, because after featuring [Hannah Levy’s bulging glass and steel sculptures last week](https://artangled.com/posts/levy-massimo/), this week it’s Colombia-born, Berlin-based painter Daniel Correa Mejía. I saw [an impressive show of his paintings and sculptures](https://www.mor-charpentier.com/exhibition/lucrecia/) at Mor Charpentier in Paris last year; now, [he’s in London](https://www.maureenpaley.com/exhibitions/daniel-correa-mejia), with a set of thick red-and-ultramarine oils on jute, depicting supernatural nude figures, are sweet and satisfying as an ice cream on a summer’s day - but are already melting from my memory.

The artist employs a visual lexicon that’s as tight as his colour palette. Flowers, seeds, trees and an evening sky surround his brick-red nudes. One of these clutches an armadillo to his muscly chest; another morphs into a dolphin, diving into a calm sea.

Correa adds in the show notes, with charming silliness: “When painting I find calm in solitude, but I also find companionship in other living beings; the animal and vegetable. The elemental beings act as allies, extensions, and reflections of myself.”

Formidable craft enables all this prettiness. Jute is an unforgiving natural material to paint on. It requires vigorous strokes, it leaves narrow margins for error. The artist plays gorgeously with evening light, shadows on skin, feathers and leaves: no mean feat under such tough conditions. On a couple of the works, he stitches some sharp sticks onto the jute canvas, with golden thread.

But, ultimately, there’s a static sameness to his figures. Despite the show's title, there seems to be no possibility of these compositions being disrupted by a predator, ever. Correa’s defaulting towards gorgeousness leaves us charmed, momentarily. We’re caught up, then we move on, ultimately unsatisfied, due to the sameyness. Or maybe that’s the royal ‘we’ and there’s a depth of interpretation to these works that I simply missed.

Either way, I'm going to feature something more challenging next week.
