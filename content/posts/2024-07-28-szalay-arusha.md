Galleries in London are already closing for the summer. It’s the beginning of the dog days, when a city-dwelling art lover needs to rely mainly on air-conditioned public collections rather than the white cubes that surround them. I found [this show](https://www.arushagallery.com/exhibitions/189-only-lovers-left-alive-ilona-szalay-london/overview/), from the Beirut-born, UK-based painter Ilona Szalay, by chance, wandering past on a humid Saturday afternoon.

I found soothing scenes inside; polite milky pinks and blues predominated. According to the gallery, Szalay works on a variety of materials, from tracing paper to LED light. This time around, it’s oil paint on glass.

This hard reflective backing means the painter doesn’t have the forgiving absorbency of canvas to smooth things out. Instead, she needs to sponge on the wash, then obliterating this wash with big brushstrokes.

Szalay likes painting women in period dress, craggy landscapes and animals. There’s a whiff of gothic novels in her scenes. A pair of works with riders on horseback, pictured above and below, made me think of the glowing horse floating along the Seine, that featured in the Olympic opening ceremony I’d watched the day before.

Szalay’s romantic rider is pictured twice, at sunrise and by moonlight. The skies are clear both times.
