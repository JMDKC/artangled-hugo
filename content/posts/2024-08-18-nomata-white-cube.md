Minoru Nomata is a fantasist. Drawn from his own imagination his landscapes feature impossible yet somehow functional-looking buildings and structures, supported by familiar-looking but equally fantastic technologies.

_Continuum-6_, pictured below, is an example. Transparent orbs float above a watery landscape, connected to the ground by translucent cables. We can imagine they were made for some kind of agricultural purpose, irrigating the land. But what makes them float? And where are the makers? (Nomata’s landscapes are, invariably, unpeopled.) It must be a scene from another time, maybe even another planet, a sci-fi dream.

Nomata’s works are all meticulously rendered in acrylic paint, and reward looking closer. Despite his generally dusty colour palette, he takes painful care over the details of his landscapes, picking out blades of grass and eddies in water. He continues his scenes over the sides of the canvas, all the way to where it’s tethered to the back of the frame: the clever curators at White Cube, [hosts of this exhibition of Nomata’s Continuum series](https://www.whitecube.com/gallery-exhibitions/minoru-nomata-masons-yard-2024), have shown off this feature by having all the works stand out slightly from the wall.

The artist explains his method, with typical precision, as “daydreaming in an awakened state of reality**”.** Exactly so. The viewer sees these landscapes as real, then steps back and appreciates their impossibility.

Precision, again: it’s no surprise that Nomata names Charles Sheeler as one of his influences. The American artist of the early 20th century was famous for his meticulously rendered factories and farms, though _they_ were apparently drawn from life rather than fantasy. He was part of an evocatively named movement called _Precisionism_. It was great to find out there’s a 21st century Japanese variant.
