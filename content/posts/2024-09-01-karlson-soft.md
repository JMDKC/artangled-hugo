Artists are often inspired by architectural ruins. You can view Maren Karlson’s rough, depressing oils and cast a through-line back centuries to painters like Hubert Robert and Canaletto. But while her artistic ancestors focused on the remains of classical temples and houses, bathed in pretty Mediterranean light, Karlson took inspiration from something more humdrum - colder - uglier.

The eight oil and graphite pencil works [on display right now at Soft Opening](https://www.softopening.london/exhibitions/staub-storung) are reimagined versions of old photos from a German chemicals factory. The originals aren’t on display for comparison, but we’re told they showed “ a rotting floor, an eroding ceiling about to collapse, twisted pipes and a hole in the ground”.

Karlson distorts these scenes so as to be almost unrecognisable, just as the heated river water that powered the chemicals factory eventually distorted its floors and ceilings. Some of her paint marks on the linen canvas rise up like scars. Her palette is relentlessly drab: bruisy yellows and browns, murky greys, highlight-free. The warped wooziness of what she paints seems… chemically induced.

The exhibition is cleverly curated. Lighting in this gallery is usually unforgiving, which suits these paintings. Some of the larger ones are propped up on irregular pieces of metal. One smaller one is arrestingly mounted within one of the steel pillars that prop up the ceiling; an industrial parody of a Classical column. Pretty to ugly. But arrestingly so.
