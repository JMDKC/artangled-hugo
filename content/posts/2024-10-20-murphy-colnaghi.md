This is [a seasonally appropriate exhibition](https://www.colnaghi.com/exhibition/the-decay-of-beauty-the-beauty-of-decay), at a time when the kerbsides of Mayfair are carpeted with the mulch of fallen leaves. It was misty in London the week I went to Conaghi; the clocks went back a few days later.

The works in this show ranged vastly from an ancient Egyptian sarcophagus face to a luminous 2002 _memento mori_ portrait from Maria Lassnig. In between, there’s a number of paintings informed by the Christian tradition of _vanitas_: still lives and skulls, there to remind viewers, then and now, of the transience of earthly goods - earthly beauty.

_Harry’s Nipple_, by the American realist painter Catherine Murphy and pictured below, makes the same point really. Of course it does - why else would it be included in the exhibition? But it makes it in a cheeky and memorable way. Executed in 2003, I think it’s the most recent work in the show.

A slightly pendulous male breast looms out at us, glowingly, from a peekaboo circular tear in a T-shirt. A corona of little white bumps surround the nipple. And there’s some stringy hairs too, some of them grey. A more flattering portrait would have excised both these imperfections, leaving us only with the round, delicate pinkness that forms the painting’s focus.

Murphy - and the other artists in this exhibition - aren’t interested in that. They want to expose the inevitable going-wrongness of our humanity. And that we might find it cheeky, repulsive or even sexy while it’s going wrong.

_The Decay of Beauty. The Beauty of Decay. is at Colnaghi (London). 09 October - 08 November 2024_
