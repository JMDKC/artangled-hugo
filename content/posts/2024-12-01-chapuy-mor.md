The young French painter and craftsman Malo Chapuy showed off a clever conceit in this tight exhibition, which was a standout among what I saw in my trip to Paris this week. At first glance, his works (several of which are on show currently at mor charpentier) look medieval. They’re small, on panels, executed with egg tempera, with frames that look hundreds of years old and lush craquelure over their surfaces.

In fact, they were painted this year, and contain subtle anachronisms. The _trompe l’oeil_ forms a sly visual joke. For example, in _Annonciation au couvent de la Tourette_ (2024), pictured below, a classic annunciation scene, employed by da Vinci and co, takes place next to the famous Le Corbusier building of the painting’s title. The show notes note that Chapuy makes (and ages) his frames, himself.

Elsewhere, a van Eyck-style seated Madonna is framed by belching factory smokestacks, just the other side of the windows that surround her. A straight retread of an Ucello battle features the horsemen cutting down wind turbines. And a devotional triptych (with rusty hinges!) features a futuristic looking orb in the background.

To be fair to the artist, what I read as clever visual jokes, could also be gestures of concern about the state of the world - its pollution, its climate change, its wars. Either way, they’re objects of beauty.

I loved a Chapuy work featuring in [a separate exhibition at the gallery, downstairs](https://www.mor-charpentier.com/exhibition/utopias-arquitectonicas/), which focused on architectural scenes. _La cité idéale_ (2022-2024) uses a well-worn Renaissance theme, of the ideal city, but updates it to a scene of 20th century apartment blocks, retreating to the sunbaked horizon, sentry-like.

The perspective is pure Piero; the atmosphere as silent and eerie as any di Chirico town square. I got up close and looked at the painstaking cracks in the paint, put there by the artist.

For some reason, I felt haunted by this scene. I didn’t see the joke. A couple of days later, passing by late at night, I stopped outside the gallery and craned my neck to look back at the ideal city once more.
