The paintings in this week’s featured show form [a kind of sequel to last week](https://artangled.com/posts/cesarotto-artist-room/). Both times now, I’m writing about small paintings in egg tempera: a quick-drying paint technique that produces notably luminous and brilliant colours.

But where Michele Cesarotto looked to his native Italian landscapes for his work, Heidrun Rathgeb, [currently on show at John Martin Gallery](https://www.jmlondon.com/viewing-room/49-heidrun-rathgeb-north-of-the-sun/), looks north. Born in Germany, she had a residency in Norway recently, and took a lot of hikes in the local area.

The resulting works, tiny paintings on gesso panels, share an overwhelming sense of cosiness and comfort.

Wooden cabins, snowy pines, dappled sunlight: it’s wholesome, untroubled subject matter. I reached out for some artistic comparison that wasn’t demeaningly generalising to the Nordic region, and gave up: it gave me Moominvalley vibes.

The figures in these landscapes are sensibly, warmly shod, trudging through the snow on a hike, or wrapped up warm in bed. A brightly-checkered bed cover is featured in more than one work on show, including _A Quiet Night_ (2023 and pictured above). Skin and fabric glows luminously, as if lit from within, thanks to the egg tempera paint.

It’s a tribute to Rathgeb’s skill that her cosiness is reassuring, rather than twee. Look at _Hut in the Wilderness_ (2023), pictured above: the silhouetted girl is in a warm, candlelit interior. A slice of nocturnal landscape on the left hand side of the frame is itself lit by a glowing yellow moon. Not a very wild wilderness; instead, we are offered comfort and reassurance all round.

“I paint what I see, but always something prompted by the poetry of a fleeting moment,” the artist says. “The feeling of an embrace, the sound of wind, the stillness of a cold winter night.” We winter viewers are offered a hug, in other words. Hugs right back.
