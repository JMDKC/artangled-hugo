The lines between fine art and really high-end product design are thoroughly blurred. At what point does an artwork for sale become a product for sale? My suggestion: we can call a work a product, and its artist a _designer_, at the point at which it could conceivably be _used_ as something. Let’s say, something you could buy at IKEA.

Nacho Carbonell comprehensively fails (passes?) the IKEA test I just made up. He makes very beautiful lamps, tables and chairs that delightfully echo chrysalids and coccons. The 30 or so [on show currently, at Carpenters Workshop Gallery](https://carpentersworkshopgallery.com/exhibitions/escapingforward-carbonell-london-2024/), almost seem to breathe as you look at them. But they’re all for sale - at [breathtaking prices](https://www.artsy.net/artist/nacho-carbonell) starting at the low five figures and stretching to the ominous “on request”.

The lamps pictured above are destined, eventually, to provide a tasteful light source in an oligarch’s penthouse. For now, the rest of us can look at them up close, on their gorgeously rusty pedestals, and see that they’re made up of shards of reconstituted glass, ribs of welded metal, and sometimes - surprisingly - craggy stone.

Elsewhere, Carbonell shows a few wall-mounted cabinets made of cork, metal and sticks that look exactly like tree trunks when closed but, when opened reveal shelving inside. It’s nice that he (and the gallery) encouraged the visitors to open them up - and also to sit on the astronomically expensive metal chairs he designed that are arranged in the large gallery upstairs.

Carbonell is clearly deeply influenced by twentieth century artists that aimed for the elemental in their work, from Jean Dubuffet to Giuseppe Penone. To which he adds a light fitting, a shelf, a seat, and takes himself the other side of the IKEA test.

When I visited, on the show’s last afternoon, the artist was in this room, explaining his working methods patiently to some ferociously well-dressed guests. (The space itself, a repurposed Victorian public hall, in the wilds of Ladbroke Grove, is part of [a global chain](https://www.vanityfair.fr/culture/article/fulgurante-success-story-carpenters-workshop) founded by a pair of French gallerists.)

Carbonell seemed really nice and open, borne out by an interview he gave accompanying the show. I bet he was the one behind encouraging visitors to touch the works. “If you want to be a creator, find something that really makes you happy, that gives you pleasure to do,” he said. “The doubts and the struggles will always come. That’s why it’s so important to be able to find something that is really fun.”

His earthy and sensual designs match this friendly vibe. I’d buy one if I was rich. But of course, I’m not. And all this beauty is undergirded by global capital, the sort that allows gallery owners to find a derelict space out by the Westway and spend vast sums to repurpose it.

Out the back of the gallery, there’s a gorgeous garden with [a Jean Prouvé house in the middle of it](https://carpentersworkshopgallery.com/exhibitions/maison-demontable-prouve-london-2024/). After my visit to the exhibition, I went out and walked around in there through an unlocked fire door, before realising I was locked out (the garden opens officially to visitors in the spring). Luckily, I was quickly rescued by an attendant after banging on a window. I thanked him and complimented him on the garden. He told me that it was in fact a very recent invention, despite the fact that it was filled with mature trees.

Apparently the “rich rich” owners had installed it all at once, trees, house and all. It had been a “hole in the ground” before. While I was walking around out there, on a cold, clear January afternoon, I’d been under the illusion that it had been here for years. And that I was meant to be there.
