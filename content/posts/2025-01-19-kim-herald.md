[This exhibition](https://www.heraldst.com/sang-woo-kim-2024) is in one of London’s more aloof gallery spaces, accessed via an unmarked doorway in an unpromising building in Bethnal Green. This past weekend, it was more singular still; the other galleries in the district were participating in the annual Condo festival, were pretty full. This one was empty when I visited. It didn’t participate in Condo. All of which is suitable for the work on show.

Sang Woo Kim paints self-portraits which are, in a word, avoidant. They are always brutally cropped, by aluminium box frames. They generally show the artist’s eyes - or an eye. Never the full face, let alone any suggestion of a body.

It’s tempting to say this avoidance is a response to Kim’s own backstory. He’s worked as a fashion model. “I’ve always tried to avoid myself in my work,” [he’s said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pq29BBRvTaM). “I guess my job entailed… how I looked. I wanted to shy away from that.” A reach, maybe, but perhaps this withholding is a reaction to the artist’s own body being literally commoditised for the enjoyment of others.

Mission accomplished. On the basis of the works on show, you wouldn’t be able to tell if the subjects are even good-looking, so brutal is the cropping. (The question of whether the [novelty and pretty privilege](https://artangled.com/posts/boty-gazelli/) of being a model-turned-painter made the show happen in the first place remains open.)

One particularly fine example is pictured above, in night shades of green. Kim lends life to his face with a single casual white trail around his eye, giving it life.

The repeated emphasis on the eye will resonate differently with different viewers. There are a few multi-part pigment transfer works to complement the self portraits: a collection of images of eyes and glasses. In one, the subject has their eyes forcibly opened by a surgical speculum.

On closer inspection, we realise these images, taken by Kim from online forums and social media, generally show white subjects. And while Kim crops away most of his face, he always portrays, with exacting, relentless brush strokes, his [epicanthic folds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicanthic_fold): a natural feature that's sometimes surgerized away. The titles of the works of his eyes are all the same: _The Fold_. In such a way, Kim asserts something more complicated and resonant about racialised beauty standards - beyond all his self-affacing avoidance.
