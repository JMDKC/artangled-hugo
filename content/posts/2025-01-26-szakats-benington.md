Maria Szakats uses a format that is traditionally domestic, modest and feminine: [small embroidery panels]((https://www.brookebenington.com/exhibitions/50-romance-apocalypse-maria-szakats/overview/). The artist laboriously stitches a cotton toile backing together, then tops it off with long, fluffy strands of mohair. Sometimes, she then worries the surface of the finished work with a metal brush.

The format matches the subject matter: portraits of women, trees and flowers, such as _Pivoine_, pictured below. So far, so traditional. But the contrast between the materials pulls focus in interesting ways. In this example, the flower of the rose is picked out sharply; its leaves, its background is woozily ambiguous, swirling.

These small panels also hint at grand things. One clue’s in the exhibition’s title - _Romance Apocalypse -_ which signals catastrophe. It stands in dramatic contrast to both the scale of the works and the subject matter. But the title hints at what I think Szakats is really going for with her embroidered flowers and ladies. They’re domestic, sure. They’re also scenes of domestic turmoil.

The mohair strands blur our perception. We can make out part of the scene, not the whole. The panels are strokably soft and fluffy, but they also signal something untamed and uncontrollable. _Romantic_ as in wild and sublime. Even apocalyptic. We all know that some domestic dramas can feel that way.

I suppose you can enact these kinds of feelings in real time, by painstakingly stitching an embroidered panel together, blurring it into semi-illegibility with mohair, then hacking at it with a metal brush.
