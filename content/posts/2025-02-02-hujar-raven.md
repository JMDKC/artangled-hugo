[Andy Warhol](https://artangled.com/tags/andy-warhol/) nicknamed the photographer [Peter Hujar](https://artangled.com/tags/peter-hujar/) “the boy who never blinked”. [This exhibition](https://ravenrow.org/exhibitions/peter-hujar-eyes-open-in-the-dark), which focuses on Hujar’s work in the late 70s and early 80s, proves Warhol right. Cacophonously hung, mixing up subjects and chronologies seemingly at random, these photographs are linked by their creator’s relentless rigour and focus.

Hujar worked fast and precisely, within tight parameters; he used a handheld camera, and developed everything in a jerry-rigged darkroom in his apartment. He shot what he saw around him, mainly in the New York City he made his home. One dizzying room at Raven Row features a chilling shot of borg-like Sixth Avenue office blocks, a gorgeously composed crowd scene on the steps of church, cruising shirtless gay men at the piers (example below) and a dizzying cityscape, taken from the viewing gallery at the World Trade Centre. In the next room you find out all these photographs were taken on a single day - Easter Sunday 1976 - and there are contact sheets to prove it.

Even if achieved through such skill, and on such a tight budget, Hujar’s pictures can seem distancing. Icily perfect in their composition and exposure. Personally, having just seen so many of them all together, I think this formal rigour is necessary given Hujar’s taste for the emotive in his subjects. It’s not just his famously blunt treatment of sex and sexuality, though there’s plenty of that on show: one pair of works, in different galleries, show Hujar enthusiastically riding an enormous dildo in one, and displaying the blown-out aftermath in another. In both photos, the slicked-down hairs of his ass, the fronds of the piece of towel he stands on, the veins on his biceps and feet, are picked out with precision and care.

Hujar loved taking photos of heart-meltingly cute animals too, and just as his precision and focus blunts the shock of his sex photos - it saves this set from being cloying and twee. One beautiful shot of a black mutt called Kirsten, from 1984, for example: the reflection of the gridded window reflected in her upturned right eye is picked out with the meticulousness of a [Van Eyck](https://artangled.com/tags/jan-van-eyck/).

Though best known as a portraitist, all these characteristics made Hujar an authoritative landscape artist, too. His attraction for the vilest grimiest rooms and streetscapes possible jars with the formality and even stateliness of his framing. In one scene of mainly empty car parks (above), the accreted rubbish around the sections of barbed wire fencing seem as beautiful as coral reefs. The electric lights glow above. Some signage in the background advertise “leather goods” (perhaps it was a cruising ground?). The whole scene has the sinister, Precisionist quality of a [George Ault](https://artangled.com/tags/george-ault/), who haunted these same west side streets decades before.

It was all over by 1987, with Hujar dead of AIDS. The show also features the famous photos of the artist on his deathbed taken by his friend and lover David Wojnarowicz. I noticed two things, once the shock had died down. Firstly, Hujar would never have let such a poorly-composed and muddily-exposed shot out of his darkroom. Secondly, his eyes are open - unblinking.
