Joseph Kosuth is one of the most severe and strict kind of conceptual artists, saying over and over again in his public statements that he’s all about the eat-your-greens _idea._ To him, a visitor deriving aesthetic pleasure from his works would be besides the point. I hope he doesn’t mind then that that’s exactly what I got from his [latest London exhibition](https://spruethmagers.com/exhibitions/joseph-kosuth-the-question-london/), a small but career-spanning collection of prints and neons at Sprüth Magers.

The neons especially. I visited on a dark winter evening, just before closing, promising the gallery assistant on the door that I wouldn’t be too long. They’d made the smart choice to light the exhibition with punishingly bright overhead lights, and no blinds on the gallery’s large windows. As a result, the neon glowed brightly through the windows, casting reflections on the Mayfair streets and roofs beyond.

Like other pioneers of the same medium ([Dan Flavin](https://artangled.com/tags/dan-flavin/) et al), Kosuth started using neon in his works in the 1960s due to its industrial ubiquity. “It was already part of popular culture as signage, and didn't have ‘high art’ associations,” he says.

“It also was clearly a temporary form of public writing, since neon only functions for a certain time and is then re-pumped or re-made. I was taking a popular form of communication but instead of announcing a product I was using that ‘voice’ to say something else.” The work pictured above, from 1991, spells out a typically Kosuth-ian semi-nonsense phrase: _The coloured intermediary between two colours._

We’re meant, I think, to ponder _where_ the colour is here. We feel a subconscious sensation of colour, looking at the colourful neon words. And a rational idea of colour, by reading the word. So far, so eat-your-greens concept.

My instinctive reaction? How cute! I took a cute photo of the work, the huge first floor gallery window lit up by the strip lighting, the bright neon. The trailing wires from the neon are clipped neatly to the wall, and are connected to plug sockets on the floor. There’s no attempt to hide how this artificial light is produced.

Probably this is an intentional choice on the artist’s part - aimed at conveying unshowy honesty. But for me, it just made the scene even cuter. Maybe I need to stop being so basic, eat more greens, and work on enjoying Kosuth’s conceptual art as pure concepts. Or maybe Kosuth should have made less cute work.
