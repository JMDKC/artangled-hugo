The work pictured below is called _Let them eat cake I._ It was created in 2020 and retitled in 2025. Its original title was _No Cookie_. It was cast in porcelain and covered in fake gold leaf. It’s intended for table display, and is currently on show inside a vitrine on a plinth. Which is quite funny, considering it’s… a cookie.

Quite an iconic cookie though, if you’re Belgian. Lotus makes Biscoff: the small, dense biscuit that’s ubiquitous on supermarket shelves, airline snack trolleys and vending machines around the world. I never knew it was Belgian. I bet most of the local the people who visit Rik Rosseels Gallery in Antwerp, [home of the vitrine the work is in](https://rikrosseels.be/en/artists/detail/anthony-duffeleer), know.

It’s tempting for me to draw links between the work and the unfamiliar country I saw it in. I’d never visited Antwerp before, and only had visited Belgium on a school trip 30 years ago, and a work trip 10 years ago. Both trips were brief.

One thing my host told me is that it’s best to speak English directly in Antwerp, rather than trying French or Flemish. Wouldn’t it be more polite to try, I wondered? No, he said. Belgians are very used to being accommodating to larger neighbours. I found that really nice but also a bit sad.

That self-effacing sentiment seems linked in my head to a local artist’s decision to cast a tiny biscuit in porcelain and cover it in (fake) gold. It’s national pride - sure - that biscuit is famous - but it’s a quiet and ironic pride. And nobody outside Belgium knows it’s Belgian.

We visited the gallery during its opening, by chance, walking by. The crowd spilled onto the street. There was a food truck serving (delicious) croquettes to staff. Duffeleer’s glass plinth, with its tiny biscuit, was hidden to me at first, because the gallery had set up a table in front of it. They were serving cava and cake to anyone who wanted it.
