I’ve never been to California. One day! But I can travel in my mind I suppose, helped by [this group show](https://www.timothytaylor.com/exhibitions/243-california/), bringing together a set of artists who were born there, or work there. Like June Edmonds, whose canvases bring together tightly-packed finger waves of solid acrylic paint (pictured below). They reminded me of mandalas and of cocktail umbrellas. They seemed to me like a shot of pure colour, hard and flat as summer sunlight.

The work’s deeper spiritual significance passed me by. According to the show notes, Edmonds bases her works on a quatrefoil symbol used by ancient (and pre-colonial) African kingdoms. The artist might be reflecting the sunshine of her adopted homeland in her work, but really, she’s thinking of her ancestors.

Hilary Pecis, whose paintings were the show’s other standout, is another painter marked out by her treatment of colour and light. Both artists use acrylic paint. But Pecis’ use of it is murky and ambiguous, compared to Edmonds’ boldness and flatness.

_Car Service_ (below) shows a nondescript street corner in Los Angeles. The perspective is a bit wonky. The buildings, road and kerbs all look a bit beaten up. The craning palm trees that frame the pavement - sidewalk? - are unhealthily skinny, sporting underbrushes of brown dead leaves.

The cloudless sky caught my eye first of all though. It’s a slightly sick off-blue, almost turquoise. It’s dusty, or maybe dirty looking. It’s somehow sinister.

It reminded me of the message stencilled on the gallery wall as I walked in: “_This exhibition was conceived and finalised in 2024, before the devastating wildfires in Los Angeles. The gallery’s thoughts are with Angelenos impacted by the fires, including artists in this exhibition._”
