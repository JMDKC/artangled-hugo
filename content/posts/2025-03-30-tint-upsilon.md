By coincidence, the artist Francine Tint was in the gallery when I visited [her exhibition](https://www.upsilongallery.com/exhibitions/54-francine-tint-radical-acts-of-beholding/). Supported by a walking stick and accompanied by two men called David, she was on her way to lunch. On her way out, she said that she hadn’t been to London for 52 years.

Tint owes an obvious debt to Abstract Expressionism, citing Helen Frankenthaler as a major influence. Back in the day, she was also friends and associates with AbEx uber-dealer Clement Greenberg. Like Frankenthaler, she’s an evocative colourist, and asserts her femininity in this most macho of movements. Tint achieves it through the dreamy blurs of her strokes, and in the occasional glitter and sparkle of gold and silver within her primary colour fields.

Looking at paintings like the one pictured above, alone now in the gallery, I found it hard to square their vigour and energy with the tiny old woman in the gallery who’d created them. And they were mainly new work!

But looking again, and there’s something meditative and considered about these thick, watery brushstrokes. It’s tempting to read into them a long lifetime of experience - that took her all the way to visiting an unfamiliar city, where her works are being shown again.

_Francine Tint: Radical Acts of Beholding is at Upsilon Gallery (London). 06 February - 29 March 2025_
