Vlassis Caniaris was a bleeding heart, whose work is both out of step with our cynical times and completely relevant to them. [This retrospective](https://www.peterkilchmann.com/exhibitions/533-vlassis-caniaris-works-from-1962-to-198011-13-rue-des-arquebusiers/) is the first in France since the artist’s death in 2011; he was also [shown at London’s Hellenic Centre in 2023](https://helleniccentre.org/event/vlassis-caniaris-selected-works-1960s-1980s/). The Paris show focuses on Caniaris’ sculptures to startling effect.

The artist, active from the 1960s, was a trenchant critic of capitalism, and a relentlessly sympathetic portrayer of those it damaged. He worked in France, Germany and his native Greece. In the 1960s in Paris, he made moving little works of modest consumer goods buried in concrete, and paralysed by it. He wrapped other objects in dirty clothes. The work is obviously indebted to “new realists” like Niki de Sainte-Phalle and Christo and Jeanne-Claude, who used similar techniques. But Caniaris is far bleaker and angrier than them.

The key work in the Paris show is 'Urinal of History', made in the 1980s after the artist had moved back to his native Greece. The three figures in a pissing posture are headless, made of wire mesh. The graffiti’d wall they face is laden with political slogans. Caniaris said that the figures stood for the “politically indifferent”. The atmosphere the work casts is profoundly antagonistic and grim.

They’re life size, and visitors to the gallery like me can walk among them, feeling vaguely implicated. Caniaris cared, and despised those who didn’t. But both he and they (we?) were still buffeted along by political and market forces bigger than them, forces that don’t care for acts of resistance, artistic or otherwise.

I saw the show on the day after the Trump tariffs were announced. Fourteen years after the artist’s death, it’s not hard to hazard a guess about what he’d have thought about it all. He’d have reflected powerfully and sympathetically on those left behind; he’d have despised those of us who, when faced with repression and other people’s suffering, tend to face the wall.
