I watched the recent remake of _Nosferatu_ on the plane to New York. Even on a tiny back-of-seat screen, I was bowled over by its _vibe_: craggy mountains, gothic ruins, the skeletal shadows of ship masts in the fog. A 200-year-old vibe pinched wholesale by the film’s director from Caspar David Friedrich.

It would have seemed so to me even if Friedrich wasn’t the subject of an [outstanding exhibition](https://www.notion.so/2025-04-27-friedrich-met-1e8a2e997bd280f28d7ac76378664b01?pvs=21), on at the Met this spring, which I particularly wanted to see.

Anyway, I’m sure Friedrich, as a deeply religious man, would be horrified to be associated with something as seedy and morally depraved as a vampire movie, once brought up to speed on what a movie is. But it’s a testament to the strength of his vibe, that what he originated in the crucible of Romanticism was powerful and redolent enough to curdle into cliché and kitsch - and to do this over centuries rather than decades. All the more surprising considering Friedrich, after some early success, fell out of favour in his own lifetime and died poor and obscure.

The Met’s galactic pulling power is evident in the fact that pretty much all of the artist’s most famous paintings are in the show. His proto-abstract _Monk by the Sea_, shockingly large and blank where so many of the other paintings are postage-stamp small. The iconic _Wanderer above the Sea of Fog_, where I noticed for the first time that the titular hero, dead centre of the canvas, is wearing a dandyish green velvet suit. It was dizzying to be with them all.

And most excitingly, _The Chasseur in the Forest_, taken from a private collection and pictured above. The interior of the pine forest so much browner and warmer than the cold, blurry reproduction that I had on a poster on my bedroom wall when I was a student. Surrounding the painting were some small studies the artist had done later in life. (The hunter, actually a lost and doomed French soldier, was executed around the time of the Napoleonic Wars.)

My favourite of all was _Spruce Thicket in the Snow_, painted from a heath near Friedrich’s home in Dresden, and usually hanging in Munich. Painted in the last decade of Friedrich's life, is a simple nature study of trees of a kind very similar to those surrounding the hunter. They’re as pointy - and sublime - as a Gothic church window. They exude sepulchral calm. Then as now, the vibes were flawless.
