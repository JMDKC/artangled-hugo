I watched the recent remake of _Nosferatu_ on the plane to New York. Even on a tiny back-of-seat screen, I was bowled over by its _vibe_: craggy mountains, gothic ruins, the skeletal shadows of ship masts in the fog. The vibe is pinched wholesale by the film’s director from Caspar David Friedrich. Maybe I was mentally primed to notice, given there's an [outstanding exhibition of Friedrich's work](https://www.notion.so/2025-04-27-friedrich-met-1e8a2e997bd280f28d7ac76378664b01?pvs=21), on at the Met, which I was particularly excited to see.

I’m sure Friedrich, as a deeply religious man, wouldn't have been pleased to be associated with vampires and the occult. But it’s a testament to the strength of the vibe, that what he originated in the Romantic early 1800s has proved powerful enough to curdle into gothy cliché. All the more surprising considering Friedrich, after some early success, fell out of favour in his own lifetime and died poor and obscure.

The Met’s galactic pulling power is evident in the fact that pretty much all of the artist’s most famous paintings are in the show. His proto-abstract _Monk by the Sea_, shockingly large and blank where so many of the other paintings are postage-stamp small. The iconic _Wanderer above the Sea of Fog_, where I noticed for the first time that the titular hero, dead centre of the canvas, is wearing a dandyish green velvet suit. It was dizzying to be with them all.

Most exciting for me was _The Chasseur in the Forest_, taken from a private collection and pictured above. The interior of the pine forest so much browner and warmer than the cold, blurry reproduction that I had on a poster on my bedroom wall when I was a student. Surrounding the painting were some small studies the artist had done later in life. (The hunter, actually a lost and doomed French soldier, was painted around the time of the Napoleonic Wars.)

My favourite of all was _Spruce Thicket in the Snow_, painted from a heath near Friedrich’s home in Dresden, and usually hanging in Munich. Painted towards the end of Friedrich's life (he died in 1840), it's a simple nature study of trees in the snow. Just like the trees surrounding the hunter. They’re as pointy - and sublime - as the ruined Gothic church windows Friedrich also loved to paint. Like his ship's masts, his seas, his mountains, his clouds, they exude sepulchral calm. Then as now, the vibe is flawless.
