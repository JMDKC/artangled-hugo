[This show](https://47canal.us/exhibitions/i-love-you-i-love-you) involves an impressive amount of production infrastructure: darkened galleries, humidifiers and “hydrophobic coating”, whatever that is.

It’s needed, because its images are excruciatingly fragile and ephemeral: fingertip drawings, of a kind rubbed on a steamy glass shower screen. (They’re actually plexiglas boxes, which look kind of the same, especially when the gallery’s dark.)

“What are traces of love?” the artist Antoine Catala asks in his show notes. “How about a fleeting intimate moment, a drawing in condensation after a shower? Can love be captured? Can it be transmitted? What about its absence, phantom love? Does it always have to hurt?”

The drawings are simple. One’s just a heart shape. Another’s a simple I LOVE YOU message. Another’s a dick, ejaculating still more love hearts.

What a lot of effort is required in order for me to see these drawings! Not just the production infrastructure, but the _money_: Catala’s show stretches across several rooms of doubtless extremely expensive Tribeca gallery space. Coming to think of it, how on earth can he sell it?

These potentially mean-spirited reflections drifted away eventually though, when I realised: it’s all as nonsensically complicated, as on-the-face-of-it absurd, as cussedly pointless, as being in love. These unbelievably fragile, unbelievably simple drawings made it to me, somehow.

“Love, I would add, in all of its candor and manipulative undertones, started to feel like an act of resistance,” Catala adds.
