“My culture has always been rooted in a certain Mediterranean spirit, but also in darkness, in folk legends,” says Mimmo Paladino. Accordingly, the Italian artist has [imaginatively responded](https://massimodecarlo.com/exhibitions/mimmo-paladino-3) to the rather chintzy upstairs space of Massimo de Carlo in London, with some sinister installations using bronze, wood and gold.

The standout is the untitled work pictured below: a mysterious figure, head turned away from us, has a gold-leafed branch stuck violently out of the board it’s painted on. The backing is gold leaf too, like an international gothic saint portrait. Except it portrays something more primitive and primal. The painting is surrounded by 90 gold leaf squares in perfect grid formation: Massimo de Carlo’s notes reveal this is a tribute to the Renaissance geometry of figures like Piero della Francesca. But the effect is truly pagan: it’s like an altarpiece, a backing for god knows what kind of sacrificial rituals.

This work rhymes with another altarpiece-like installation, executed by another Italian veteran, also [on show across town](https://www.serpentinegalleries.org/whats-on/giuseppe-penone-thoughts-in-the-roots/). Giuseppe Penone started working a decade or so earlier than Paladino, in the 1960s, and is associated with arte povera: a movement that prized working with humble materials above all.

Penone’s specialism was trees, which he’s described as “a prime example of a perfect sculpture”. In _Alberi libro_ (’Book Trees’ - pictured above), from 2017 and on show in the main room at the Serpentine galleries, a series of bare trunks are hollowed out, and intricately carved with twig like forms that climb up up up to the sky. They look like the bellows of some kind of celestial forest organ.

This altarpiece seems spiritually uplifting and rooted in nature, where Paladino’s is mathematically man-made. But both centre on the natural geometry provided by our trees. Both are - as I said before - deeply pagan. Both are worth seeing this May, with the city’s trees in full leaf.
