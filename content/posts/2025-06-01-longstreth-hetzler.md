The title of Jake Longstreth's [current exhibition at Max Hetzler](https://maxhetzler.com/exhibitions/jake-longstreth-california-landscapes-2025) is as clear and descriptive as the work on show. These are _California Landscapes_, painted from the state the artist lives and works. Dry, open spaces filled with trees, bushes, and topped with clear blue skies.

In Longstreth's compositions, the foliage surrounds pristine-looking man-made structures: a NASA laboratory, the bright blue flank of an Amazon Prime truck, a mirrored-glass building reflecting the sky with a single car out front. Several tennis courts.

Longstreth’s use of oil paint reflects this unopinionated, even passive approach. The surfaces are smooth, with little texture or gesture.

The artist’s colour fields are crisp and bright. Light - hard, flat sunlight - shapes everything. Against this, shadows fall deep and sharp. The effect is more formal than atmospheric. There doesn’t seem to be a wisp of breeze, ever.

These paintings are as entirely unopinionated as the show’s title. The elements — natural and man-made — don't feel portentous or moody: they're simply part of the landscape. The scenes are still and depopulated, but this stillness doesn’t seem eerie. They’re just… there.

Longstreth's work recalls David Hockney's early California period in its directness and clarity. It also brings to mind his contemporaries Hilary Pecis (another Californian, though one more interested in the scuzzy and down-at-heel) and Brian Alfred.

There's no narrative here, no symbolism to unpack. The word the artist uses to describe tennis courts — a repeated motif — is “benign”. It describes his landscapes in general, too.

When faced with such benignity, forming a critical opinion of the work - good, bad, or anything other than _something_ - seems besides the point. Instead, we can simply enjoy the view.
