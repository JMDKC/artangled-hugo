Richard Wright’s [exhibition at Camden Art Centre](https://camdenartcentre.org/whats-on/richard-wright) is beautiful and left me feeling a bit sad. Apparently working without assistants, he has painted beautifully detailed patterns in acrylic and pencil directly onto the walls of the gallery. But they’re only temporary and will be painted over when the show closes later this month.

That’s part of the point. Wright has worked this way for years. His site-specific wall paintings are made to disappear. His similarly intricate gold leaf and gouache works on paper, some of which are also on display in Camden, pay the bills — along with private and more permanent commissions in rich benefactors’ houses.

The gallery’s architecture shapes the show. Camden Art Centre was once a Victorian library, which you could guess from some of the flourishes and adornments in its vaguely oriental decorative cornicing and vents. Later extensions added flat concrete planes. Wright responds to this mix. Across the walls of the gallery, his patterns wrap corners, follow ceiling lines, or echo the shape of nearby windows.

The visual language is familiar. Wright uses repeated black-and-white lines, precise geometries, and muted colours. The wall drawings suggest Bridget Riley but without the optical dazzle. Some compositions recall Mondrian in their balance of control and mysteriously satisfying asymmetry.

On a weekday visit, the space was almost empty, which seemed appropriate to the mood the works cast.

Lucky me, it was sunny and still. The stillness of Wright’s work isn’t spiritual or emotional — it’s formal. The atmosphere was hushed and reflective. The paintings don’t dominate the space; they invite you in. I stayed longer than I meant to and left thinking, not long left.

_Richard Wright is at Camden Art Centre, London, from 26 April to 23 June 2025._
