On one hand, you could say [this exhibition](https://saatchiyates.com/exhibitions/once-upon-a-time-in-london) is invigoratingly ambitious. On the other, you could say it’s just an epic, empty show-off. I’m in the middle, somewhere.

The dense hang could be a nod to the [Summer Exhibition](https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibition/summer-exhibition-2025), just up the road at the [Royal Academy](https://artangled.com/tags/royal-academy/). (The fact that the exhibition dates almost exactly match - with the Saatchi Yates show opening five days earlier and closing on the same day - could be a coincidence, or could be cheekiness.) The only difference is, here _everybody_ is famous. And the average cost per work will be much, much higher.

So, the list includes Lucian Freud (three copper etchings - I had never seen one of his etchings before!), a [Tracey Emin](https://artangled.com/tags/tracey-emin/) neon, a murky [Leon Kossoff](https://artangled.com/tags/leon-kossoff/) landscape, a couple of [Francis Bacon](https://artangled.com/tags/francis-bacon/) portraits. Jenny Saville, Chris Ofili, [Paula Rego](https://artangled.com/tags/paula-rego/) - the list goes on.

A few contemporary artists are dotted around, like trailing space dust around the stars. One that caught my eye is Joanna van Son, whose [beautiful show at General Assembly](https://artangled.com/posts/van-son-general/) I’d enjoyed earlier in the year. Her dreamy, thickly-impasto’d group portrait faces a small yellow-hued work by [Frank Auerbach](https://artangled.com/tags/frank-auerbach/): her big inspiration.

The show as a whole is bumptiously ambitious. Like the gallery that houses it. The press release reveals that Saatchi Yates has launched a membership scheme (just like the RA!) and [is also selling a commemorative tea towel](https://saatchiyates.com/shop/other) from a celebrity interior designer. It’s called _Arts Things Nicky Haslam Finds Common._

_Once Upon a Time in London is at Saatchi Yates (London). 12 June - 17 August 2025_
