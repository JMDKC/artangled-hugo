This [new Tate show](https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/edward-burra) of Edward Burra - [one of the artists](https://artangled.com/posts/burra-pallant/) [I’ve covered most](https://artangled.com/posts/craxton-pallant/) [on here](https://artangled.com/posts/beryl-tom-voltaire/) - is the first retrospective in London in 40 years. In fact Burra, who died in 1976, had a monograph show at the Tate prior to his death, and, after the Hayward exhibition in 1985 also had a large show at Pallant House in Chichester in 2011. Not exactly Picasso, but not exactly obscure.

It’s easy to pick holes in this one as a confirmed fan of Burra’s work. The galleries are a bit poky and the sequencing is eccentric: it’s divided by nation, reflecting Burra’s love of travelling despite his crippling arthritis and semi-invalid life in what he termed “tinkerbell town”, his home in Rye. So, one room for France, one for the US, one for Spain, and finishing up with his sinister war paintings, theatre sets and late landscapes.

As a fan, I’ll go back and add impressions in throughout the summer and autumn. For now, I’ll leave it at one of the works on display, pictured above, from my favourite Burra period: the early caricatures of people having fun. This time, it’s three sailors, their bulges lovingly delineated by Burra’s brush (the watercolour brush the only one his arthritic hands had the physical strength to hold). Note the surreally floating table, the obsessively worked woodgrain, the visual joke of the chrome… cock.

I’ll add in more as I go.
