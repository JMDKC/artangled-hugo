What did you think, said the gallerist, as I made to leave. I never know how performative to be on the rare occasions I get the question: do I leave it at “oh, great”? Do I reformulate something from the press release? Or do I give my actual opinion?

This time around (on the final afternoon of [this exhibition](https://desbains.co.uk/Lewis-Davidson-Electric-Fall)), I went for the latter. It reminds me of festival tents in a field, I said. I think - but didn’t say - that this is probably because I saw the show on the final really warm day of summer, the very end of festival season, and tents like this had been a mainstay on my social media feeds for months.

As the press release makes clear, festival tents absolutely isn’t the artist Lewis Davidson’s inspiration for these works. They’re made from plastic carrier bags he picked up from the streets of London. On many of these streets, you see tents, and even encampments of tents, put up by homeless people, driven to the margins in a tough economy.

They’re urban leftovers, these tents. Made of fragile material, not thick enough to protect the tent-dweller from the harsh elements, outside. Davidson nails his mini tents to uncompromising steel shelves. They’re lit from within. They’re “speculative architectures of refusal and retreat”, as the press release puts it.

But, in a darkened gallery room in Fitzrovia, they glow like luxurious Christmas lights. They’re vulnerable, sure, but they’re also pretty. Almost festive. It wasn’t what the artist was going for. But it’s what I took from him. Oh well.

Anyway, after I gave my view, the gallerist raised his eyebrows and said, haven’t heard that one before. I was mildly embarrassed and left. Probably I’ll stick to the press release next time.
