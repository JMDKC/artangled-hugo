Victor Man’s current work references mystical, colour-drenched early 20th century symbolist and expressionist works. A collection of several of these paintings, many of whose figures glow bright green on gloomy backgrounds, is [currently on show at David Zwirner](https://www.notion.so/Gabriel-28aa2e997bd2806bbc63c2cf2876134e?pvs=21).

As well as a sickly green skin tone, Man’s portraits share some scary surroundings. They’re beset by skulls, ghosts and thorny plants. Their (facial) expressions tend towards the impassive, despite these apparent torments.

To hammer home the spooky, backward-looking nature of the art, the show’s press release quotes from a crepuscular text by Georg Trakl, an Austrian expressionist poet who died in 1914. ”…the flickering candlestick dies in slender hands. Hour of lonely sinisterness, mute awakening in the hallway in the sallow web of the moon…” And so on.

Overwrought words that would link as well to Trakl’s contemporaries Kandinsky or Franz Marc as they do to Victor Man. Though the paintings at David Zwirner are more morbid than either of _them_.
