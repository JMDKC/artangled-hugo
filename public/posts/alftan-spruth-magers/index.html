    <h1>Henni Alftan: Contour | Sprüth Magers</h1>

    <p>The painting below is called <em>Tinted</em>. It really stood out to me when I visited <a href="https://spruethmagers.com/exhibitions/">the artist’s show at Sprüth Magers</a>, which opened this week. The painter, Henni Alftan, is Finland-born and Paris-based. She takes her inspiration from everyday mundane human scenes, except the human beings are absent. A prevailing theme in exhibitions featured here recently, including <a href="/posts/demand-spruth-magers">one from Thomas Demand</a> (at the same gallery) and <a href="/posts/hwang-pontone">another from Hwang Seontae</a>.</p>
<p>Alftan’s scene is viewed through a half-opened car window: a strip of beach, a flat sea, a powdery blue sky. The tint of the window is marvellously cleverly done, the patch of sea uncovered by the glass is blue and clear, the glass-covered sea slightly more smoky, amorphous.</p>
<p><img src="/alftan-spruth-magers-1.jpeg" alt="Henni Alftan - &amp;lsquo;Tinted&amp;rsquo;"></p>
<p>The atmosphere is of unsettling absence. The car must have a driver, but they’re out of view. The car is probably moving - is it likely a stationary car would have its window open? - but there are no signs of motion.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Alftan plays with other absences: a curtain almost conceals a window, a hallway mirror reflects a staircase, a pile of books is carefully composed, but slightly out of whack, with only half the title on the single visible spine appearing in frame.</p>
<p>These partial obliterations continue in the human figures depicted in the paintings: a hand here, a shoulder here, a neckline there. Perhaps the most telling is <em>ON/OFF</em>, a pair of paintings of light switches, and fingers closed around them, suspended during the action of switching.</p>
<p>It’s a diptych of which each painting is in a different room. We don’t know we’ve seen a pair until we’ve seen both. A typical move from such a withholding artist. She slightly obscures the meaning; like the sea is slightly tinted, when seen through a car window.</p>
<p><em>Henni Alftan: Contour is at Sprüth Magers (London). 10 June - 30 July 2022</em></p>
