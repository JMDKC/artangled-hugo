    <h1>Alice Anderson - Body Disruptions | Waddington Custot</h1>

    <p>Alice Anderson is known as a performance artist as well as a visual artist, but <a href="https://www.waddingtoncustot.com/exhibitions/132/">this show is definitely big on the visual wow factor</a>. Dominating the larger gallery at Waddington Custot are a series of copper-wire-covered monoliths. Anderson calls them <em>Body Disruptions</em>, and they’re built by wrapping the wire around a rectilinear wooden structure so that it forms repetitive motifs and patterns.</p>
<p>As an artist, Anderson’s very interested in digital connectivity, and of course copper wire’s a transfer medium for online information. (Elsewhere in the show are some crayon-on-paper works where keyboard symbols are repeatedly depicted until the shapes break down into illegibility.) But regardless of source, these objects are highly impressive craftworks.</p>

<p>There’s a machine-like, gem-like precision to the patterns, a simultaneous heft and lightness to the sculptures. Things go a bit haywire in the show notes, which details Anderson’s research into the Indiens Kogi, a community in a remote part of Colombia.</p>
<p>This found expression in her <em>Nuhé</em> series, featuring totem pole-like structures wrapped with copper wire. The internet connection seems to have been lost here. But they’re impressive objects too. Isn’t that enough?</p>
<p><em>Alice Anderson: Body Disruptions is at Waddington Custot (London). 12 March - 10 May 2019</em></p>
