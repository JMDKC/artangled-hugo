    <h1>It’s a Magda Archer Christmas | Karsten Schubert</h1>

    <p>Merry Christmas one and all! Unless you want a festive spin around London’s commercial galleries - in which case you’ll find they’ve all shut due to the COVID wave that’s engulfed the city recently. Some people didn&rsquo;t get the message though, and like me speculatively walked the streets of Mayfair yesterday, armed with a negative LFT test, getting repeatedly confronted by locked doors.</p>
<p>So, this last single-show post of the year - next week as usual it’s a roundup of my five top shows of the year - is about something I saw a couple of weeks back. But it’s still pretty festive, considering <em><a href="https://www.karstenschubert.com/exhibitions/234-magda-archer-its-a-magda-archer-christmas/">It’s a Magda Archer Christmas</a></em> features both a lovely decorated pine tree in the main room and an opened box of Quality Street at the front desk. Given I was wearing my mask, I didn’t partake.</p>

<p>Magda Archer has worked as a commercial illustrator, and her bright acrylic paints and cartoon captions are naturally sellable. It isn’t a surprise that there’s merch on sale at the front desk too, though a couple of arty-but-rich gallery goers having a loud conversation about school fees kept me away from taking too close a look. Call it social distancing.</p>
<p>There’s something of a Rose Wylie junior in the deliberate kiddy zaniness - like Wylie, I was surprised when I found out how <em>old</em> Archer, born in 1964, is. And there&rsquo;s something of David Shrigley, <a href="/posts/shrigley-stephen-friedman">featured here last week</a>, in Archer&rsquo;s combination of crowd-pleasing fun and gimlet-eyed capitalism.</p>

<p>Or maybe there was something off about the atmosphere, which made me grumpy and grudging about Archer’s fun and appealing paintings.</p>
<p>“I keep thinking about buying a kiln,” a well-dressed fellow viewer brayed, as I beat a retreat down the dark staircase in Soho that leads to this atmospheric gallery. With talk in the air of an incoming circuit-breaker lockdown, I hope I’ll be back before too long. It won’t be in time for Christmas, so let’s make it a new year’s resolution.</p>
<p><em>It’s a Magda Archer Christmas is at Karsten Schubert (London). 02 - 22 December 2021</em></p>
