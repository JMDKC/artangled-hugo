    <h1>Francesco Arena - Cubic Metre of Seawater as a Diagonal | Sprovieri</h1>

    <p>Two shows from Italian artists caught my eye this week. First,  <a href="https://www.sprovieri.com/exhibitions/francesco-arena3">this exhibition from Franceso Arena</a> at one of the west end’s least accessible galleries, up a flight of stairs behind Regent Street. Arena makes vaguely arte povera-aligned works, using natural and found materials.</p>
<p>The centrepiece of this show is rather grandiose: exactly as the title suggests, seawater is contained in a metal trough, 13 metres long, oriented diagonally across the largest gallery. Why a cubic metre exactly? Arena tends to use standard measures in his works, as these measures are after all an expression of the man-made upon nature.</p>
<p><img src="/arena-sprovieri-1.jpg" alt="installation view"></p>
<p>We look at the tank with a sense of immensity constrained. A similar tension between the man made and the natural appears in other works in the show: my favourite was of a <em>Times</em> newspaper, discussing the latest Brexit doom and gloom, wrapped around a hefty slab of solidified concrete: and not quite holding it all in.</p>
<p>And a similar sense is evoked by the <a href="https://www.thomasdanegallery.com/exhibitions/222/works/">Luigi Ghirri show across town at Thomas Dane Gallery</a>. This photographer, whose retrospective at Jeu de Paume I wrote about earlier this year, found fame in the 70s by photographing simple scenes around the comfortable suburbs of Modena, his hometown.</p>
<p>He did broaden his repertoire as his short career went on (Ghirri died in 1992) but this exhibition focuses on his star-making turn from the early 1970s, *Colazione sull’erba.*While never straying far from peaceful scenes of carparks, gardens and advertising posters, the photographer - who trained as a surveyor - is always precisely locating his photographs within gridlines and boundaries.</p>
<p>Immensity constrained, from two different periods in Italian history!</p>
<p><em>Francesco Arena - Cubic Metre of Seawater as a Diagonal is at Sprovieri (London). October 02 - November 15 2019</em></p>
