    <h1>America&#39;s Cool Modernism - O&#39;Keeffe to Hopper | Ashmolean</h1>

    <p>I just love Edward Hopper - and I&rsquo;m not sorry about that, sometimes popular things are also really good. More generally, I love the various early 20th century movements of artists reacting to machinery, industry and the burgeoning suburbs (see earlier posts on <a href="http://artangled.com/2018/02/18/sironi-estorick/">Sironi</a> and <a href="http://artangled.com/2018/06/03/kupka-grand-palais/">Kupka</a>.) The &lsquo;America after the Fall&rsquo; exhibition at the Royal Academy was hands down my favourite show of last year. So I was gagging to see <a href="https://www.ashmolean.org/americascoolmodernism">this exhibition</a> from the moment I first read about it.</p>
<p>Predictably I loved it, from the gorgeous (and iconic) Hopper etchings, to daffy Helen Torr, to Charles Sheeler&rsquo;s perfectly reverant factories, to Ralston Crawford&rsquo;s monolithic grain tubs, to a couple of totally irresistible Stuart Davises. I spent hours in there, mainly in the room dealing with the Precisionists: a 20s/30s group concerned with the cool, perfect cities. New to me was George Ault, who contributed two perfectly sinister little paintings, including this one, of a factory in Hoboken at dusk.</p>
<p><img src="/ault-ashmolean.jpg" alt="Installation view"></p>
<p>If Hopper provides the creep factor with his urban landscapes, Ault&rsquo;s abandoned streets and buildings shade into outright dread. Ault once referred to skyscrapers as the &ldquo;tombstones of capitalism&rdquo; and considered the industrialized American city &ldquo;the Inferno without the fire&rdquo;. He worked during the Depression, and it&rsquo;s no coincidence that his factory is utterly empty of people or, well, industry. Its beauty is in its silence, its very perfection an implied threat.</p>
<p>The Precisionists worked to celebrate the new landscape of skyscrapers and factories, through apparently realist, but actually stiff and hard-edged, depictions. Everything seems perfectly clean and just-so. Visible brush strokes are unusual. And it&rsquo;s this very perfection that lends a lot of the work, Ault&rsquo;s definitely included, with a clammy, claustrophobic air.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t reflect reality, though. Elsewhere in the show is a showing of &lsquo;Manhatta&rsquo;, an avant-garde film shot (in part) by Sheeler. Ault was working in New York at around the same time. Far from the icy - even arid - perfection and quietude of both men&rsquo;s painted work, the city the film depicts is unbelievably filthy, striated with gungy factory smoke, the buildings sooty and shopworn.</p>
<p><em>America&rsquo;s Cool Modernism: O&rsquo;Keeffe to Hopper is at the Ashmoleoan (Oxford). 23 March - 22 July 2018.</em></p>
