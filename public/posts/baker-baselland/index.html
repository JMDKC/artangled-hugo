    <h1>Interlude - Brigham Baker at Kunsthaus Baselland</h1>

    <p>I can’t find much about the Zurich-based artist Brigham Baker on the internet, beyond a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/brighambaker/?hl=en">nice Instagram account</a>. But when I emptied my mind and allowed some gallery memories to drift in (aka, the start of composing one of these lockdown posts), I thought about his beehives.</p>
<p>I saw them at Kunsthaus Baselland, as part of <em>Beehave</em>, a <a href="https://kunsthausbaselland.ch/en/ausstellungen/beehave">group show celebrating the honeybee</a> - which was a lot less cutesy than it sounds, considering many of the artists used the animal as a symbolic harbinger of climate change, war and so on.</p>
<p><img src="/baker-baselland-1.jpg" alt="installation view - brigham baker beehave"></p>
<p>Baker’s contribution was pictured above - elegant blocks of hive honey on spindly steel frames. As elegant as a Mondrian, lit from behind like stained glass windows in a church. The work linked in my head with a Miró sculpture in the next room - <em>Girl with a bee’s nest hat</em>, in that it focussed on the bee’s prime aesthetic contribution to the natural world: those gorgeous interlocking hexagonal honeycomb patterns.</p>

<p>Looking closer at the hives, the honeycomb was lit up in different colours from the sun - a simple but gorgeous effect. (The exhibition was created in cooperation with the Fundació Joan Miró in Barcelona.)</p>
<p>Anyway, my notes from the show, seen a couple of years ago now, suggest that other works featured photographs of dead bees, and a room downstairs where the viewer was encouraged to walk across honeycomb patterns on the floor while listening to techno music on their headphones. I don’t remember that at all - but for some reason, these elegant steel structures are on my mind today.</p>
<p><em>Beehave was at Kunsthaus Baselland (Basel). 14 September - 11 November 2018</em></p>
