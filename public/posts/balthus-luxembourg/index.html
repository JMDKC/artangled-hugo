This plea not to look too closely is appropriate for this artist, considering the fact he was a snob, a vile anti-semite despite his Jewish heritage, and is most famous these days for his unabashedly erotic pictures of little girls.">

    <h1>Balthus: Under the Surface | Luxembourg &#43; Co</h1>

    <p>The notes for <a href="https://luxembourgco.com/exhibitions/78/works/">this show</a>, apparently the first Balthus exhibition in the UK since 1968, contain the following Oscar Wilde quote: “All art is at once surface and symbol. Those who go beneath the surface do so at their peril. Those who read the symbol do so at their peril.”</p>
<p>This plea not to look too closely is appropriate for this artist, considering the fact he was a <a href="https://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,954274,00.html">snob</a>, a <a href="https://www.salon.com/2000/01/04/weber/">vile anti-semite</a> despite his Jewish heritage, and is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/oct/21/balthus-cats-girls-paintings-provocations-metropolitan-review">most famous these days</a> for his unabashedly erotic pictures of little girls. (I’m guessing that’s the main reason there hasn’t been a show of his here for half a century.)</p>
<p>I’ve written about many monstrous individuals who also produced great art on here before: <a href="/posts/sironi-brun">Sironi</a>, <a href="/posts/nolde-bastian">Nolde</a> and <a href="/posts/picasso-tate">Picasso</a>, to name some of the worst. Balthus was certainly a monster - what about the art?</p>
<p><img src="/balthus-luxembourg-1.jpeg" alt="Balthus, &amp;lsquo;Le poisson rouge&amp;rsquo; (1948)"></p>
<p>He was self-taught, and came to specialise in frozen and foreboding portraits, rendered in thick oil paint. The expressions of his deliberately primitively-rendered sitters are always blank - intentionally blank. If awake, they stare out at us in a state of suspended animation, lifeless but also, somehow, charged. The atmosphere they cast is utterly distinctive, and it’s hard to look away.</p>
<p>I found it easier to deal with this small, tightly-curated exhibition than the <a href="https://www.fondationbeyeler.ch/en/exhibitions/past-exhibitions/balthus">massive Balthus retrospective</a> that I went to a few years back at Fondation Beyeler, with room after room of this stuff. That said, the London show still packs a predatory punch, with Luxembourg + Co having heightened the atmosphere by painting the gallery walls a lurid orange.</p>
<p>The works are an impressive collection, though one stands out. <em>Le poisson rouge</em> from 1948, pictured above, is a mini masterpiece of psychological tension, a strange doll’s head on a table mirroring the fishbowl, a hollow-eyed cat staring out at us, ready to yank the tablecloth out and destroy everything. Balthus was obsessed with cats, and often used them as stand-ins for himself in his work.</p>
<p>And what about the little girls? They’re in three group portrait paintings from the 1940s, and in a couple of (much later) drawings. All feature the same pose - reclining, one leg hitched up, a posture of sexual submission that’s also seen in <em><a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/489977">Thérèse Dreaming</a></em>, Balthus’ most infamous work of all.</p>
<p>Back to Luxembourg &amp; Co’s show notes, which refer to these scenarios as “dreamlike”. I agree and disagree. Looking at Balthus, you do feel caught somewhere between waking and sleeping. But it’s not an untroubled sleep - it’s like waking up after a daydream after a heavy meal in an overheated room. Stimulating, but somehow nauseating too.</p>
<p><em>Balthus: Under the Surface is at Luxembourg + Co (London). 03 March - 04 June 2023</em></p>
