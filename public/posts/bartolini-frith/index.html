    <h1>Massimo Bartolini - Credits | Frith Street Gallery</h1>

    <p>It seems like a long time ago, now: a world where taking a trip to Italy was an indulgence, rather than an impossibility. I used some of my two days in Turin, back in late 2017, to visit the Fondazione Merz, a converted Lancia factory in a pretty suburb. Sitting on its concrete floor as the September sun slanted through its high windows, the space rebounded with metallic clanks, whizzes and hisses. <a href="http://fondazionemerz.org/en/exhibitions/massimo-bartolini-four-organs/">That’s where I first encountered the work of Massimo Bartolini</a>.</p>
<p>This artist&rsquo;s noisy work - across video, sculpture and mechanical musical instruments - shares some of the anarchic spirit of Mario Merz, the Turinese arte povera great who gave that foundation its name. I was glad to <a href="https://www.frithstreetgallery.com/exhibitions/massimo-bartolini-credits">meet Bartolini again</a> in the rather weaker March London sun. The dim confines of Frith Street Gallery on Golden Square ring to some of the same sounds I heard in Turin. That’s because there’s a work in common between the two shows, an octagonal black metal well like structure, <em>In a Landscape</em>, whose internal barrel organ-like mechanism plays a haunting tune at random-seeming intervals.</p>
<p><img src="/bartolini-frith-1.jpg" alt="credits"></p>
<p>But the main sounds in the London gallery are of hands clapping. They’re for the pair of works that give the exhibition its name. On one wall, a video of tree trunks, with eyes blinking in time to the claps. On the other, an endlessly-spooling sequence of credits with deliberately silly names of a vaguely classical bent. Or that’s what I thought at first: in fact, it’s a list of the Latin names of different extinct animals.</p>
<p>Bartolini <a href="https://thenetgallery.com/a-conversation-about-landscape-massimo-bartolini/">says</a> that the show is “a way to think about Landscape with different media”. Fair enough. But the endlessly-spooling list of the dead has other implications at times like this. Now, with the news cycle darkening by the day, not least from Bartolini’s native country, I wonder at how bleak this show seems in retrospect. And that sunny, carefree afternoon in Turin seems even further away.</p>
