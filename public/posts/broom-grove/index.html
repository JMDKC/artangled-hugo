    <h1>Orlanda Broom: Shapeshifters | Grove Square Galleries</h1>

    <p>Producing this <a href="https://www.grovesquaregalleries.com/exhibitions/shapeshifters/">collection of abstract works</a>, made with colourful resin on canvas, must have taken a toll on the artist. Orlanda Broom can only work on works using resin for a couple of months each year - otherwise the ambient temperature isn’t right. The perfectionist artist also doesn’t allow any resin works with trapped hairs and dust out of the studio.</p>
<p>“I’m interested in the interpretation of abstract works,” she says. “I enjoy that people respond and read the paintings in their own way. I like making space for the personal, subjective response of the viewer and I have a strong desire to allow the viewer their own flow of thought.”</p>
<p><img src="/broom-grove-1.jpeg" alt="orlanda broom - warp"></p>
<p>Let’s take <em>Warp</em> above as an example. As the artist suggests, it’s so tempting to try to make out forms in these vibrantly colourful shapes. Maybe something tiny, like a cell; maybe something cosmically huge like a galaxy. The colours, slightly translucent, almost seem to tremble in front of us - though of course, set resin can never move again. Even what seem to be brushstrokes and patterns in the resin are illusory: looked at from the side, the surface of these shiny pools is entirely flat.</p>
<p>The shinily deceptive effect of the works reminded me of the artist Rachel Howard, whose work with drips of gloss paint I’ve featured a <a href="/posts/howard-newport">couple</a> of <a href="/posts/howard-lee">times</a> on this site. But Broom’s practice is even more unforgiving: her resin sets quickly into something hard and immovable, the patterns appearing once, then never changing again.</p>
<p>Broom&rsquo;s forms seem like shapeshifters. But that’s all a trick of the eye. The shapes aren’t shifting: they’re locked, trapped in their hard, glossy, reflective carapace. Final interpretation is resisted.</p>
<p><em>Orlanda Broom: Shapeshifters is at Grove Square Galleries (London). 16 June to 30 July 2022</em></p>
