    <h1>Lee Bul - Crashing | Hayward Gallery</h1>

    <p>What a weird show this is! Following their <a href="http://artangled.com/2018/02/25/gursky-hayward/">stellar Gursky retrospective earlier in the year</a>, and some bad juju prior to opening when <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/arts/artwork-catches-fire-before-new-lee-bul-exhibition-at-the-hayward-gallery-a3851226.html">one of the works caught fire</a>, what remains is a <a href="https://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/whats-on/exhibitions/hayward-gallery-art/lee-bul">majorly varied grab-bag</a> of paintings, installations, costume, architectural maquettes, a light show and a big-ass zeppelin. It&rsquo;s less of a sensory assault than a really expensive jumble sale.</p>
<p>The show definitely highlights that Lee Bul is epically productive. Outside of the Hayward&rsquo;s concrete walls, I&rsquo;d seen <a href="https://www.ropac.net/exhibition/after-bruno-taut">a show of new work from her</a> earlier in the year at Thaddeus Ropac, my first of hers, and it was way glitzier than anything that I saw at Hayward. It also focused on only one tiny part of her repertoire: fantasy architectural maquettes, done up in crystals, metal shards and ropes.</p>
<p><img src="/bul-hayward.jpg" alt="Installation view"></p>
<p>So - I really liked the plenitude and breadth of what&rsquo;s on show. But I think the artist&rsquo;s hamstrung by some odd curatorial choices. Lee&rsquo;s hilariously confrontational performance pieces from the late 80s and early 90s, for example, totally new to me and totally riveting, are relegated to six tiny screens in a side gallery. The much more inert zeppelin - &lsquo;Willing to be Vulnerable&rsquo;, (2015-16) - while very pretty, gets an entire massive upstairs room to itself.</p>
<p>Worst is the &lsquo;City of the Sun&rsquo; installation which ends the show. It&rsquo;s definitely technically impressive: forming a labyrinth of black glass, interspersed with panels of lightbulbs. It&rsquo;s definitely Insta-friendly. Perhaps too much, though: even on a late opening towards the end of the show&rsquo;s run, the queue snaked around the room. And with only four people allowed in at once, progress was pretty slow, and the end result underwhelming. Though maybe I got off lightly, an attendant told me that wait times were two hours earlier in the summer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bad impression to leave with, because so much of the rest is amazing. I loved the sinisterly biomorphic costumes, with wormy wriggles shooting out of the sleeves, one huge red &lsquo;dress&rsquo; that bears a stomach-churning resemblance to a &lsquo;rat king&rsquo;, and the ineffably cute but sinister &lsquo;Cyborg&rsquo; series. The large-scale sculptures are also fascinating. My favourite of all was &lsquo;Thaw&rsquo;, a block of translucent ice that, you can see when you look closely, contains a waxwork of the corpse of Park Chung-hee, the brutal South Korean dictator.</p>
<p>Elsewhere is &lsquo;Heaven and Earth&rsquo;, a dirty tiled floor and industrial looking bath, filled with pitch black water. (Park Jong Chul, a student activist against his namesake&rsquo;s regime, died following water torture in 1987, in a death emblematic of the bad old days.) Hayward&rsquo;s imaginatively reconfigured downstairs space is a great host for these revelatory works.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a shame that the order of rooms wasn&rsquo;t reversed, so that the visitor could have left on a high.</p>
<p><em>Lee Bul: Crashing is at Hayward Gallery (London). 1 June - 19 August 2018.</em></p>
