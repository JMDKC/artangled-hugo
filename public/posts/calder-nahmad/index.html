    <h1>Calder/Miro - Clair de lune | Nahmad Projects</h1>

    <p>Alexander Calder and Joan Miró were good friends, with a lot in common. The same goes for the work, too, and <a href="http://nahmadprojects.com/exhibition/calder-miro-clair-de-lune/">this dreamy little exhibition</a> proves it. Working in Paris, both took the most crowd-pleasing bits of the Surrealist movement they were surrounded with, and expressed it in antic, zany, colourful form. Calder made mobiles, Miró paintings.</p>
<p>They’re both still really popular: the last couple of years having brought major retrospectives for Calder at the Whitney, and Miró at the Grand Palais. The show at Nahmad Projects, a tiny fortress-like space in Mayfair, is, necessarily, much tighter.</p>
<p><img src="/calder-nahmad-1.jpg" alt="installation view"></p>
<p>It’s structured by two pairs, one small and one large. Pictured above is Calder’s <em>Red Stalk</em> (1955) and a little Miró oil, <em>Chien enragé</em>, from the same year.</p>
<p>The larger pair is from 1964: <em>Blue and Yellow among Reds</em> from Calder and <em>Oiseau dans la nuit</em> from Miró. Calder’s mobile is hanging temptingly above head height: it was made in the same year as his first big Guggenheim retrospective.</p>
<p>A particularly happy moment for a particularly happy artist. This show made me smile.</p>
<p><em>Calder/Miro: Clair de lune is at Nahmad Projects (London).  22 February – 18 April 2019</em></p>
