    <h1>Lea Cetera: Chassis | Phyilida Reid</h1>

    <p>The titular work in <a href="https://www.phillidareid.com/exhibitions/lea-cetera_chassis">this exhibition</a> is fascinatingly described in the show notes. It’s a “motor-powered gyroscopic structure based on a rotocasting machine”, in which a small transparent figurine is pinned between steel frames, and periodically spun around.</p>
<p>It’s a hypnotic work, most powerful when the growly motor stops. Contained in this (female) plastic body are red and blue liquids, that combine to form a purple goo, that mostly settles wherever the figurine is angled during the rest periods, but leaves the odd spatter in the areas above the watermark.</p>

<p>Lea Cetera, based in New York, examines “bodily fragmentation and objectification”, the notes add, though the viewer will certainly have guessed that based on the other video works on show. <em>Giant Cuttlefish</em>, <em>Giant Conch</em> and <em>Rainbow Lobster</em> show these grand beasts of the sea helpless  on the fishmonger’s slab, being cut up for parts, destined for some posh restaurant table.</p>
<p>These videos, sourced by Cetera from YouTube, are overlaid with grimly humorous words and phrases, my favourite being the simplest: <em>SWIM</em>. To add to the sense of threat, the screens are partially obscured by brightly coloured metal grilles.</p>
<p>In this way, the artist shows how the organic can be circumscribed and contained by the man-made and the mechanical: knife, frame, motor. But the bright colours of the grilles and liquid keep things from being too grim. It’s a memorably chipper presentation of a depressing message.</p>
<p><em>Lea Cetera: Chassis is at Phillida Reid (London). 02 September - 01 October 2022</em></p>
