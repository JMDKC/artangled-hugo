    <h1>Witness | Pilar Corrias</h1>

    <p>China&rsquo;s home to one in four people, and many of the world&rsquo;s fastest growing cities. Four different Chinese artists&rsquo; responses to the city <a href="http://www.pilarcorrias.com/exhibitions/witness-chen-wei-cui-jie-hao-jingban-zhang-ruyi/">are currently on show at Pilar Corrias</a>.</p>
<p>Chen Wei, now resident in Beijing, stood out to me. One lovely photo in particular, <em>New Buildings</em>, (2016), a rainy window, dappled with condensation, lit up with multiple colours, suggesting windows and signage in a street behind.</p>
<p><img src="/chen-pilar-corrias.jpg" alt="Installation view"></p>
<p>This weirdly wistful image is a bit of a trick, though. The exhibition notes reveal that Chen carefully constructs his interiors in his own studio.</p>
<p><em>Now Buildings</em> is part of Chen&rsquo;s ongoing &lsquo;New City&rsquo; project. In this series of photos, &ldquo;I hope to highlight the gap between people&rsquo;s imagination of the city and the reality, and the gap is one of the tragic elements,&rdquo; <a href="https://ocula.com/magazine/conversations/chen-wei/">the artist told an interviewer</a>, last year.</p>
<p>One thing these imaginary city scenes have in common? There aren&rsquo;t any people in them. Beijing has around 20 million residents, and is growing at a rate of 1m per year. Such emptiness, in other words, is becoming increasingly rare.</p>
<p><em>Witness is at Pilar Corrias (London). 7 April - 4 May 2018.</em></p>
