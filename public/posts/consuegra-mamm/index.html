    <h1>La Vuelta | MAMM</h1>

    <p>Shining out from <a href="http://elmamm.org/Exposiciones/Detalle/Id/1381">this group show</a> in Medellín’s very impressive modern art museum was Nicolás Consuegra’s series of square-format found photos. They depict a show of their own: ordinary families proudly displaying their Renault 4 or R4, the most popular Colombian car of the 70s and 80s.</p>
<p>What do I see, as a foreigner, in these photos? Certainly something different to the typical Colombian, who’d be deeply familiar with the shape of this low-cost family hatchback, which became as ubiquitous as the Volkswagen Beetle over in Mexico.</p>

<p>The R4 was the first affordable, yet reliable, car in Colombia. Is it gratuitous to reflect that it hit the mainstream during a dark time for the country - unimaginably dark, from the perspective of an impeccably bougie gallery, converted from an old industrial unit, in an exceptionally beautiful and welcoming city?</p>
<p>Is it a leap too far to detect a sinister edge to Consuegra’s decision to blur the old photos: not to illegibility, but enough to cause confusion, or spark a sense of eeriness?</p>
<p>One mother - or grandma - hoists her child proudly onto the roof of a shiny white model, a placid blue sea, all rough waters blurred out of existence, behind. She seems to be smiling, but we can’t be sure.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://nicolasconsuegra.com/portfolio/uno-de-nosotros-entre-nosotros-con-nosotros/">another maternal scene</a>, a young mum leans out of the driving seat, proffering a placid baby in pure-white swaddling clothes. And there’s a young man - or maybe woman, the blur makes it impossible to tell - in a plunging v-neck and flares, leaning against their Renault, proudly possessive.</p>
<p>Consuegra culled the original versions of the photos from a celebratory press release from Renault back in 2004, and says he put them together to showcase “middle class lives of that moment, and their sense of ownership of a vehicle that developed a personality of its own”. The R4, after all, had become known in the country as <em>el carro colombiano</em>, a signifier of unity and progress.</p>
<p>So maybe that “sinister” or “eerie” feeling is actually the artist lending a sense of universality to a happy national moment?</p>
<p>Anyway, I didn’t know any of that backstory until I did some research of my own. Testament to Consuegra that his images have such force, without the context.</p>
