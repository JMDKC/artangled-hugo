    <h1>Spencer Finch: Lux and Lumen | Hill Art Foundation</h1>

    <p>“Ye cannot serve God and mammon,” claims the gospel of Matthew. But <a href="https://hillartfoundation.org/art/exhibitions/view/lux-and-lumen/">the Hill Art Foundation</a> gives it a good go. This small gallery is owned by hedge fund billionaire J. Tomlinson Hill, and is currently hosting a beautiful bringing-together of a Renaissance stained glass window and various stained glass installations from contemporary artist Spencer Finch.</p>
<p><em>The Creation and the Expulsion from Paradise</em> was completed by Valentin Bousch in 1533, and has most recently been a prize possession of rich American collectors: it used to be installed above William Randolph Hearst’s fireplace, according to the show notes. Now it belongs to Hill.</p>
<p><img src="/finch-hill-1.jpeg" alt="Spencer Finch &amp;lsquo;Painting Air&amp;rsquo; (installation view)"></p>
<p>In its new temporary home, Bousch’s (or should that be Hill&rsquo;s?) illuminated Adam and Eve, his God the Father and Holy dove, all gaze out on Finch’s main installation, entitled <em>Painting Air</em>: perfect squares of clear glass, suspended from the ceiling by a cats cradle of wires and overlooked by a chatty guard who wished to make <em>very</em> sure visitors weren’t wearing backpacks before getting into range. The show must have been a nightmare to install and maintain, in other words.</p>
<p>It’s worth it. Reflections and colours drift across the clear glass panes: from the bold colour fields on the gallery walls, from the spectacular floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking 10th Avenue, and from the 500-year-old billionaire-coveted stained glass in the corner. It’s one of the most breathtaking things I’ve seen.</p>
<p>“Sometimes the light is magical in New York,” Finch said in an interview. “It will just feel like - maybe this is a sort of sacred light… And then it passes. You then get back on the subway and you have some horrible experience. But for a moment, it feels like a magical, wonderful place. It’s almost the Holy Spirit entering you or something.”</p>
<p>A feeling that’s reflected in the show&rsquo;s title. <em>Lux</em> means natural light, <em>Lumen</em> is sacred light. Through art, the former may be transmuted into the latter, like water into wine. Equally, hedge fund money can buy - or fund - great art, which in turn allows others to gain, briefly, free transcendence. A process that might not be sacred in Biblical terms, but yields undeniable benefits, whatever your beliefs.</p>
<p><em>Spencer Finch: Lux and Lumen is at Hill Art Foundation (New York City). 16 September - 04 March 2023</em></p>
