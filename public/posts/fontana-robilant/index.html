    <h1>Immaterial - Fontana Ceramics | Robilant &#43; Voena</h1>

    <p>I had a cringeworthy encounter with an in-house camera crew when I visited the HangerBicocca in Milan a few years ago. On <a href="https://pirellihangarbicocca.org/en/exhibition/lucio-fontana-environments/">stepping into the enormous space</a>, I was confronted with one of mid-century maestro Lucio Fontana’s neon <em>Ambienti</em>, hanging, glowing blue, from the ceiling. What do you think of Fontana, the crew asked me, on the lookout for some promo content. I nervously mumbled something about not seeing him often in London.</p>
<p>Which I’ve been proved comprehensively wrong about ever since. Fontana’s still a big, collectible, deal. So there’s been a standout show of his <em>Teatrini</em> frames <a href="http://nahmadprojects.com/exhibition/lucio-fontana-i-teatrini/">at Nahmad Projects last year</a>. And now, a <a href="https://www.robilantvoena.com/exhibitions/207/">career-spanning show</a> for his work in fired clay at Robilant + Voena, a couple of streets away.</p>
<p><img src="/fontana-robilant-1.jpg" alt="installation view"></p>
<p>This impressive room features some early experiments with figurative sculpture, in the form of a couple of equestrian statues from the 1930s. From the later career, there’s a couple of chillingly biomorphic shapes of his zippy 60s heyday. And it’s all contextualised by his trademark slashed and punctured monochrome canvases, on the walls.</p>
<p>Cleverly, the gallery contextualises Fontana’s artistic progression with some choice works from his contemporaries. So there’s a couple of lovely equestrian statues from Marino Marini. And a captivating gridded white cloth work from the master of the minimal, Piero Manzoni.</p>
<p>As ever with this gallery, the exhibition is tight and smart. One Christmas wish to its directors, though: open at the weekend please so I can enjoy the gallery more often!</p>
<p><em>Immaterial - Fontana Ceramics is at Robilant + Voena (London). October 15 - December 20 2019</em></p>
