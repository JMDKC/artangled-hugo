    <h1>The Forest | Parafin</h1>

    <p>I’ve always liked a good <a href="https://artangled.com/empreinte-malingue">thematic group show</a>, and <a href="http://www.parafin.co.uk/exhibitions--2021--the-forest.html">this one at Parafin</a> didn’t disappoint. The theme is &rsquo;the forest&rsquo;, which are part of our shared consciousness, even for those of us who live in the middle of large cities. Across different cultures and times, the forest represents a quiet place to retreat to and hide. But it&rsquo;s also a lonely place, where monsters may lurk.</p>
<p>The exhibition begins with <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Gustave_Dor%C3%A9_-_Dante_Alighieri_-_Inferno_-_Plate_1_.jpg">an engraving</a> from the mystical French artist Gustave Doré to set the scene. It’s an illustration of the opening canto of Dante’s <em>Divine Comedy</em>, portraying one of literature’s <a href="https://poets.org/poem/inferno-canto-i">most famous forests</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Midway upon the journey of our life<br>
I found myself within a forest dark,<br>
For the straightforward pathway had been lost.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Doré’s forest isn’t a place of sanctuary, really, his protagonist casting a confused look over his shoulder as he treads over gnarly tree roots. The un-straightforward pathway is completely blotted out by overhanging branches. It’s dark in there, confusing. As well as beautiful.</p>
<p><img src="/parafin-forest-1.jpeg" alt="Indrė Šerpytytė - Forest Brothers IV (2009)"></p>
<p>This theme of beauty and threat persists in my two favourite works from the exhibition. The Lithuanian photographer Indrė Šerpytytė photographed forests as part of her <em>1944-1991</em> series. Close cropped, her layers of trees and undergrowth merge into each other, the variegated effects of light and shade confusing the viewer&rsquo;s depth perception. The forest is palpably sinister; we can hardly see where the ground is, and our eyes strain for what’s hidden under the canopy. The example above is <em>Forest Brothers IV</em> from 2009.</p>
<p>In fact, Šerpytytė photographed hiding places for Lithuanian resistance fighters, &ldquo;forest brothers&rdquo;, who battled, and hid from, the Stalinist Soviet regime in the aftermath of the Second World War. The dense foliage of forests served as a dark sancturary for these men, who had left their homes for fear of being put to death. Their refuge among the trees was involuntary. Each brother was alone.</p>
<p>So the work plays into the double-edged forest feeling described above: the forest as a place for solace and retreat, but <em>at the same time</em> as a threatening, lonely place.</p>
<p><img src="/parafin-forest-2.jpeg" alt="Melanie Manchot - Remains (End of the World) (2018)"></p>
<p>A similar sense of foreboding pervades a series of pictures from UK-based German photographer Melanie Manchot. In two works at Parafin, she depicts traces of snow left behind in dense pine forests, at night. <em>Remains (End of the World)</em>, from 2018 and pictured above, lives up to its apocalyptic title. The snow on the ground is almost the only source of light, weakly reflecting a single patch of sky visible at the top of the frame.</p>
<p>Everywhere else is pervading blackness, with the pine tree canopy extremely dense. Only a few tree trunks are picked out in the gloom. The forest seems endless. It’s beautiful - and thank you Parafin for leaving this C-print uncovered by any reflective surface to take away from the deep blacks of this photograph.</p>
<p>The silent sylvan scenes captured by these artists - Doré, Šerpytytė, Manchot - have great natural beauty, but are freighted with dread. That the same mood persists across all three works is a tribute to the exhibition’s great curation, as well as the power of this cultural archetype. I loved to get lost in these forests, safely surrounded by the bustling city on a rainy summer afternoon.</p>
