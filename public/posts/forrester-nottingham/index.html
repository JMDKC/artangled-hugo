    <h1>Denzil Forrester - Itchin &amp; Scratchin | Nottingham Contemporary</h1>

    <p>When I first saw Denzil Forrester’s paintings, <a href="https://www.stephenfriedman.com/exhibitions/past/2019/denzil-forrester-a-survey/">at an exhibition at Stephen Friedman last May</a>, I did what I usually do when I see an artist’s work for the first time: try to think of what - or who - it reminds me of. The connection I made in my head with Forrester was with the Italian photographer Massimo Vitali. Maybe not the most obvious kinship, but both artists have a love of the crowd - party scenes packed with people looking their best. Crowds were, for obvious reasons, on my mind.</p>
<p>There are obviously many differences between the two, extending well beyond their choice of medium. Rather than Vitali’s precisely delineated smart beach resorts and tragic-looking nightclubs, Forrester’s scenes are lyrical, colourful, hazy purples and pinks picking out huge stacks of speakers in long, narrow, rooms - the disco ball overhead, the firmly shut security doors on the far one. He cites other artistic connections, saying in interviews that he learned from Monet and Cézanne, those pastel-coloured masters, as well as the clear sunlight of Italy, where he travelled in the 1980s.</p>

<em>Night Strobe</em></p>
<p>Back in London, he went to a club called All Nations, in Hackney. I can’t even imagine how grotty that part of the city was in the depressed 80s, but under Forrester’s sympathetic brush, it becomes a magical playground, rainbow-coloured soundwaves bouncing off the walls and ceiling and over the heads of the beaming partygoers.</p>
<p>Forrester’s gone nationwide, not only in <a href="https://www.nottinghamcontemporary.org/whats-on/denzil-forrester-itchin-scratchin/">this show in the very smart Nottingham Contemporary gallery</a>, which features <em>Night Strobe</em>, pictured above, but also on the other side of the Thames, preparing an <a href="https://art.tfl.gov.uk/projects/brixton-blue/">enormous public work at the top of the staircase in Brixton tube station</a>, as part of the Art of the Underground series. (Another work from which  <a href="http://artangled.com/2018/07/21/eggysrub-gloucester/">I’ve previously covered on here</a> .)</p>
<p>The artist was involved in the dub-reggae scene back then, but there’s something deliberately universal in the crowd in <em>Night Strobe</em>. All nations, in fact. Forrester has <a href="https://www.timeout.com/london/news/this-londoner-painted-the-underground-nightlife-of-80s-hackney-053118">explained to an interviewer</a> that he sketched on A1 paper in the clubs back then, not wanting to capture faces, but movement. He rationed himself to one sketch per song; this explains the fast, loose strokes.</p>
<p>“In these clubs, city life is recreated in essence: sounds, lights, police sirens, bodies pushing and swaying in a smoke-filled room,” he added. It’s nice to think of a time where bodies push and sway with no worries, only colours and light.</p>
