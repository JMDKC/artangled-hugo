    <h1>Fun House | Josh Lilley</h1>

    <p>This is definitely the first gallery exhibition I&rsquo;ve been to that&rsquo;s <a href="http://joshlilleygallery.com/exhibitions/fun_house_2018">named after a 90s kid&rsquo;s TV show</a>. (If you don&rsquo;t remember the essential after-school viewing for now-thirtysomethings &lsquo;Fun House&rsquo; with Pat Sharp, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAA8WK_inOI">this video should help you out</a>.) But there&rsquo;s not much to tie that &ldquo;messy technicolour treat for kids&rdquo;, as the show notes have it, to this rather sober collection. It&rsquo;s a group show, and the artist in it that most stood out for me is American photographer Genevieve Gaignard, who I&rsquo;d spotted <a href="http://www.stephenfriedman.com/exhibitions/past/2018/talisman-in-the-age-of-difference/">at a previous exhibition at Stephen Friedman</a>, and read about <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/photo-booth/an-artists-costumed-alter-egos-cross-racial-lines">in this (excellent) New Yorker profile</a>.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a racially-ambiguous, suburban Cindy Sherman, who&rsquo;s <a href="http://artangled.com/2018/06/17/sherman-spruth-magers/">still on show up the road at Spr√ºth Magers</a>. Both artists appear in disguise in their photos, trying on different personas as they go, stage-managing their own stories. But while Sherman has recently retreated into ironic 20s glamour, Gaignard is down home and direct. She appears in two forms at this show. First, there&rsquo;s the unsettling stare of &lsquo;Waiting&rsquo;, a Floridian Mona Lisa in contrapposto pose, blazes out from the wall of the gallery.</p>

<p>In a black beehive wig and a yellow top, she sits on a sickly yellowish chair. It&rsquo;s a dark room, her face catching the light. You can&rsquo;t help but look at her luscious, brightly-painted lips. Then you notice the beautiful formality of the pose, offset by the out-of-kilter framing: she&rsquo;s shot from above and to the side. Elsewhere in the show is &lsquo;Hidden Faces&rsquo;, where Gaignard is a differently-attired suburban temptress, perhaps a proud homeowner, teetering on her lawn, her electric-blue beret perfectly matching her front door and shutters. A perfectly featureless lawn. This particular face is hidden, partly, by huge false eyelashes.</p>
<p>This is another definite hit for a gallery that&rsquo;s been on <a href="http://artangled.com/2018/03/18/pichlkostner-josh-lilley/">a really strong run recently</a>.</p>
<p><em>Fun House is at Josh Lilley (London). 5 July - 10 August 2018.</em></p>
