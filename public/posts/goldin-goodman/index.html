    <h1>Nan Goldin - Sirens | Marian Goodman Gallery</h1>

    <p>This is Nan Goldin’s <a href="https://www.mariangoodman.com/exhibitions/351-nan-goldin-sirens/">first London solo show in almost 20 years</a>, and it’s really drawing the crowds. The exhibition begins with one of the US photographer’s trademark digital slideshows, <em>The Other Side</em>, a compilation of 25 years of candid snaps of her friends on society’s margins. The next room features some of the stills from which she sourced the slideshow.</p>
<p>Her subjects, showgirls, drag queens and groupies, have plaquey teeth, smoke a lot of cigarettes and are photogenically skinny. They’re shot with a deliberate lack of compositional care and are deliberately awkwardly lit. Goldin defined this style that’s still with us, though the subject matter of cross-dressers and drug addiction lacks its power to shock in a world of RuPaul on the BBC and class As on the dark web.</p>
<p><img src="/goldin-goodman-1.jpg" alt="installation view"></p>
<p>On the rest of the ground floor, there’s a couple of theatrical video installations, one of which, <em>Memory Lost</em>, deals movingly with Goldin’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/22/nan-goldin-interview-us-opioid-epidemic-heroin-addict-oxycontin-sackler-family">hideous-sounding past addiction to Oxycontin</a>. Upstairs, there are some negligible, semi-abstracted landscapes. Which if nothing else are suggestive that the world-famous photographer now has a lot more budget to play (and travel) with.</p>
<p>Goldin’s friend Peter Hujar has <a href="http://www.jeudepaume.org/index.php?page=article&amp;idArt=3420">a retrospective on at the Jeu de Paume right now</a>, which I found, in its glassy formal perfection, a vastly more engaging and moving take on similar subject matter. But maybe that’s me being a picky critic, always trying to compare. Goldin and Hujar were great friends, and learned a lot from each other.</p>
<p>Neither seem life-changingly relevant today, but that’s as much due to the artistic world they helped create through being so influential. They helped set the scene.</p>
