    <h1>Andreas Gursky | Hayward Gallery</h1>

    <p>An early high point in Andreas Gursky&rsquo;s wonderful show, <a href="https://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/whats-on/exhibitions/hayward-gallery-art/andreas-gursky">currently on at the Hayward Gallery</a>, is a photo called &lsquo;Schiphol&rsquo;.</p>
<p>This early-ish (1994) work, looking out onto the runways of the titular airport, was taken at a time of transition for the artist. Gursky was increasingly turning to digital photography, and to the &ldquo;aggregate states&rdquo; for which he&rsquo;s most famous today: complex, heavily retouched depictions of late capitalist workplaces, landscapes and cityscapes. These huge photos, absorbing as a Where&rsquo;s Wally picture, are well represented at the Hayward show. As are his earlier, smaller, quieter, works: a little cluster of cyclists with their backs turned, plane-spotting at DÃ¼sseldorf airport (<a href="http://www.andreasgursky.com/en/works/1985/duesseldorf-sonntagsspaziergaenger">&lsquo;Sunday Walkers&rsquo;, 1985</a>), or a square of bobbly grey carpet at a local art gallery (<a href="http://www.andreasgursky.com/en/works/1993/ohne-titel-1">&lsquo;Untitled&rsquo;, 1993</a>).</p>
<p><img src="/gursky-hayward.jpg" alt="Schiphol"></p>
<p>This picture of a terminal, and a runway, seemed to me to be a turning point between the two styles. There&rsquo;s the thought-through detachment of the &ldquo;aggregate states&rdquo;, and their de-individualisation - while Schiphol is a very busy airport, it doesn&rsquo;t have any people or planes in this picture. But there&rsquo;s also that warmth and curiosity, so present in the early works, that got lost later.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Schiphol&rsquo; maintains the non-judgmental eye Gursky previously cast on the shabbily-clad, keen planespotters, and withdrew from his spectacular later photos of sweatshops (<a href="https://www.mumok.at/en/nha-trang">&lsquo;Nha Trang&rsquo;, 2004</a>), superstores (<a href="http://100photos.time.com/photos/andreas-gursky-99-cent">&lsquo;99 Cent&rsquo;, 1999</a>) and an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/jan/26/andreas-gurskys-amazon-exposing-the-mindlessly-cruel-forces-of-global-capitalism">Amazon warehouse</a> (2016). Later, Gursky also moved into more on-the-nose political statements, critical of the man-made, the globalised. Contemptuous of consumerism.</p>
<p>But, here, there&rsquo;s an easy, just-right quality about this quiet airport scene, even though it represents the same capitalist system, the global movement of people and cargo.</p>
<p>The later work has an icy perfection: the reflective ceiling of that 99 cent store is carefully retouched, while whole sections of the riverbank of <a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/gursky-the-rhine-ii-p78372">&lsquo;Rhine II&rsquo; (2015)</a> are ironed out and reworked. But this airport terminal is a little dirty, with some dots of lint on the gridded tiles. There&rsquo;s a slightly stained - maybe rusty - sideboard. And the joins of the ceiling are not quite meeting. Which somehow makes the man-made achievement more impressive. Look at the elegant curves and meanders of the runway approach, the solid planes of the glass, the satisfyingly regular grid of the tiles.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Schiphol&rsquo;&rsquo;s sinuous runway approach has a darker counterpart, later in the show. <a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/gursky-bahrain-i-p79322">&lsquo;Bahrain I&rsquo; (2005)</a> is a totally horrifying aerial photograph of a desert Formula 1 track. These ribbons of road are undulating through a sandy hellscape. The black of the track, and sun-blasted white of the sand, is interrupted only by little bright-red roadside Vodafone logos. In the background, there are two helipads. The pitiless light that shines on the track, an absurd man-made imposition on a hostile landscape, is hazy with sand. It represents a global, money-driven, glitzy sporting roadshow. Just-right has turned to just wrong.</p>
<p>But, somehow, the simple pleasure taken by the photographer in the earlier photograph seems like a more radical political stance.</p>
