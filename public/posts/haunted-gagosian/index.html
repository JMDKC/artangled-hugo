    <h1>Haunted Realism | Gagosian</h1>

    <p>This is a <a href="https://gagosian.com/exhibitions/2022/haunted-realism/">typically epically show-offy group exhibition</a>, in which various contemporary and 20th century A-listers face each other down in large galleries police by black-clad security men. A confluence of art celebrity, crammed together: here, a wall full of Richard Prince photos loomed over a Rachel Whiteread bed; there, a Jenny Saville bum rubbed against what looked to be a string shopping bag with a chunk of polystyrene inside (in fact it was a bronze and marble sculpture from Tatiana Trouvé).</p>
<p>I’m not snarking, there’s something delightful about that much star power in one place, and there were loads of unexpected great works to see. The gallery states they are aiming for a vibe of “ghostlike… lost futures” with this exhibition. My favourite example of that is pictured below: <em>Industrial Complex</em>, produced by Richard Artschwager in 1967.</p>
<p><img src="/haunted-gagosian-1.jpeg" alt="richard artschwager - industrial complex"></p>
<p>The grainy black and white image is of a low-slung, featureless, inscrutable building, designed for no-nonsense work. Artschwager painted it (in acrylics) on celotex. Or, insulation board. We can barely make out the building, given the heavy background pattern of the backboard. It’s a highly characteristic work from Artschwager, who painted on other rough and ready materials like formica during the 60s.</p>
<p>The work also reminded me of <a href="/posts/laing-levy-gorvy">an awesome show I saw at Lévy Gorvy a few years back</a>, based around artists in the same era taking inspiration from the ben-day dot: people like Gerald Laing and Sigmar Polke reproducing rough print magazine images as high-luxury art objects.</p>
<p>Back at Gagosian though, it was great to see a work that so thoroughly hit the brief provided by the show notes. An industrial building depicted on rough industrial material. A material that lends the work  an air of rugged mystery that seems… well… haunted.</p>
