    <h1>My Head is a Haunted House | Sadie Coles HQ</h1>

    <p>It’s not quite Hallowe’en, but there are plenty of anticipation-building creepy thrills to be had <a href="https://www.sadiecoles.com/exhibitions/713/press_release_text/">at this show</a> , curated by writer, curator and horror movie obsessive Charlie Fox.</p>
<p>Everywhere you look, there’s work blurring the lines between scary, funny and… a bit deviant. From Sam McKinnis’ reverent paintings of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, to a pink laser show from Matt Copson, to some truly disgusting - even by his standards - Larry Clark photos. Maybe the most spectacular, though, is Marianna Simnett’s plushy sculpture of a hyena in breeches getting it from behind from a swan in an evening dress.</p>

<p>Slightly embarrassingly, this is the second time in a month that <a href="http://artangled.com/2019/06/23/juliano-de-carlo/">I’ve featured some kind of artwork featuring a) cuddly toys and b) penetration</a>. I couldn’t help mentioning Simnett’s effort, given it was the most spectacular (and photographed) thing at the show. She’s one to watch:  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mariannasimnett/?hl=en">her Instagram is great too</a> !</p>
<p>There’s <a href="http://artangled.com/2018/03/18/pichlkostner-josh-lilley/">another old Artangled friend on show, Alex da Corte</a>, in a spooky video featuring the artist dressed as Frankenstein, mashing up his supper food in various inventive ways.</p>
<p>Credit to the curator for making it all hang together. I guess one factor is because he’s tapping into universal emotions. As Fox says: “When I was a weird little kid in suburbia obsessed with horror of all kinds, my grandfather (who isn’t alive anymore) built me a haunted house. I could pretend I was a ghost or a bat or a werewolf crying blood over a cardboard tombstone.</p>
<p>“It was a make-believe world where my imagination could get deranged and it was magic. My Head is a Haunted House grew out of that hallucinogenic memory and its psychic hold on me.”</p>
<p><em>My Head is a Haunted House is at Sadie Coles HQ (London). June 15 - August 21 2019</em></p>
