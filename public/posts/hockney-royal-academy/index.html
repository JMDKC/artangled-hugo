    <h1>David Hockney: The Arrival of Spring, Normandy, 2020 | Royal Academy</h1>

    <p>While the world went into lockdown last Spring, David Hockney, ensconced in his comfortable country house in northern France, took out his iPad and captured the passing of the seasons.</p>
<p>Through circumstance, <a href="https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibition/david-hockney">this Royal Academy show</a>, containing 116 of these iPad pictures, comes at a time when lockdowns are over, and the Burlington House courtyard and the city beyond is ever more crowded. We’re having a springtime, then, even with the days getting shorter.</p>
<p><img src="/hockney-royal-academy-1.jpeg" alt="david hockney - normandy 2020"></p>
<p>Even aged 82, Hockney has remained relentless, churning out a picture a day or so at the time, observing the gradients of light on a favourite view, the wire garden furniture outside his window, a treehouse with a precarious ladder he surely doesn’t climb up anymore. Bare branched trees get leaves, blossom. None of the works are named, only numbered.</p>
<p>The show is arranged roughly thematically - a group of flower pictures here - a pair of night views there. The works are mainly, deeply chocolate boxy. Hockney’s a living legend, and he’s assembled enough cred as a living legend to get away with being this banal.</p>

<p>In a video interview accompanying the show, <a href="https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/article/video-david-hockney-interview-arrival-of-spring-exhibition-2021">Hockney says</a>, accurately: You’ll come out feeling better. I felt very excited by it - spring is a joyful time, especially in Northern Europe, after you’ve had a winter with the bare trees.”</p>
<p>All those years in California, with less dramatic seasonal changes, meant that he was inspired in coming back in later life.</p>
<p>Taken together, the exhibition’s as enjoyable and transient as an early April sunrise. Just like spring, he leaves us with the promise of more to come.</p>
<p>Less inspiring or joyful is the message just outside the galleries, banning photos of the works - that’d be digital reproductions of digital reproductions - at the artist’s request. Nice flex though David!</p>
<p><em>David Hockney: The Arrival of Spring, Normandy, 2020 is at the Royal Academy (London). 11 August - 26 September 2021</em></p>
