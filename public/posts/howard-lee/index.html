    <h1>Rachel Howard: You Have a New Memory | Simon Lee</h1>

    <p>I first featured the British painter Rachel Howard <a href="/posts/howard-newport">on this site in 2018</a>, when I saw a stately and sombre show of hers in Damien Hirst’s cavernous Newport Street Gallery. Back then, she showed works based around the stations of the cross. This new exhibition, <a href="https://www.simonleegallery.com/exhibitions/225/">Howard’s first at Simon Lee</a>, is a more intimate affair, both spatially, in that the Mayfair gallery’s a bit pokier, and in the subject matter.</p>
<p>Howard’s famous for large-format gloss paintings, like the ones she showed at Newport Street. But in this new show there are a set of smaller-format oil paintings, each featuring the same view: a country lane, with an overhanging tree and a gate. <em>Path to Edge (gold)</em>, pictured below, is an example.</p>
<p><img src="/howard-lee-1.jpeg" alt="rachel howard - path to edge (gold)"></p>
<p>According to the show notes, Howard has obsessively painted this particular view, “the path to Edge”, for a decade. I guess it’s a country road to the town of Edge in Cheshire. Perhaps it’s near her studio. Perhaps she paints from photos. Perhaps it’s just a scene in her mind’s eye that she can’t let go of.</p>
<p>More extreme formal experiments can be seen in the larger format works, though Howard maintains the pastoral theme of the exhibition.</p>
<p><img src="/howard-lee-2.jpeg" alt="rachel howard - laughing tree"></p>
<p><em>Laughing Tree</em>, pictured above, features the vertical drip pattern I noticed - and loved - in the artist’s Newport Street Gallery exhibition. Horizontal colour blocks are overlaid with a stencilled, wallpaper-like designs of trees and flowers. These slowly fade out as the eye travels down the large canvas.</p>
<p>Howard has made increasing use in recent years of spraying paint over and through stencils, lending works like this a formal regularity.</p>
<p>She brings the medium of paint together to create a mood of emptiness. Of almost-but-not-quite harmony. Kind of like a country road as the night draws in. Pretty, but with a sense of something sinister lurking in the shadows…</p>
<p><em>Rachel Howard: You Have a New Memory is at Simon Lee (London). 01 October - 14 November 2021</em></p>
