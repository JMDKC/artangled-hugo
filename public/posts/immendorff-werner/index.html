    <h1>Jörg Immendorff - Questions from a Painter Who Reads | Michael Werner</h1>

    <p>This is an artist who was a really big deal in his native land. I first heard of Jörg Immendorff when I visited his <a href="https://hausderkunst.de/en/exhibitions/joerg-immendorff">enormous retrospective</a> at the Haus der Kunst in Munich last year, spanning his early political paintings of to his complex, gloomy, finely-wrought late works, painted as the artist was dying of ALS. A hideous way to go - and he went in 2007.</p>
<p>Now, Michael Werner is <a href="http://michaelwerner.com/exhibition/5497/information">showing a cycle of huge paintings from the final year</a> in its lovely winter garden, with some other examples of another Immendorff period - his fervent and optimistic 70s paintings of heroic workers and artists, working together to trash capitalism in some impressive wing collars and flares.</p>
<p><img src="/immendorff-werner-1.jpg" alt="Immendorff"></p>
<p>Immendorff suffers from his attachment to - from the perspective of the comfortable 21st century West - obscure causes (hardcore Marxism) and forgotten struggles (German reunification). And, throughout, along with monumental scale, his works are also handicapped by his inscrutable humour.</p>
<p>I don’t get the joke. Not so much due to the silly stereotype that Germans aren’t funny, but because he’s funny in a way that’s mysterious to this British viewer. In stark contrast to the more digestible larkiness of his compatriot and contemporary AR Penck, who had <a href="http://michaelwerner.com/artist/a-r-penck/exhibition/2018/information">a revelatory show</a> at the same gallery last year.</p>
<p>But then again, there’s something fascinating in his lost 70s world of Communist struggle. <em>Mannesmann - Entlassung</em> shows the artist side by side with a factory worker, both sporting some spectacular examples of the decade’s pointy collars and billowing flares. You can practically hear the polyester crackle.</p>
<p>It all ended in disillusionment: <em>Parlament</em>, painted just two years later, shows an assembly of wolves - politicians of all ideologies clearly disgusted him by then.</p>
<p><img src="/immendorff-werner-2.jpg" alt="Immendorff"></p>
<p>The deliberate crudeness and boldness of Immendorff’s brushwork is all gone by that final cycle in the winter garden: the finer grain depictions of strange half-men-half-beasts are offset by the artist’s final act, deep into a remorselessly degenerative neurological disease: a random-seeming disfigurement of splotches of thick, black paint. Death is universal; senses of humour aren’t.</p>
<h3 id="other-highlights">Other Highlights</h3>
<p>I saw a <a href="http://www.tornabuoniart.com/carlo-rea-forms-and-harmonies.html">lovely selection of mixed media works</a> from Italian artist Carlo Rea at Tornabuoni Art: plaster petals painstakingly glued on to monochrome canvases, the overall effect being as if it’s bursting open with flowers. Just as pretty was the UK’s <a href="https://www.hamiltonsgallery.com/exhibitions/123_irving-penn_paintings/works/">first show of fine art photographer Irving Penn’s paintings</a> at Hamiltons. Generally from late in the photographer’s career, they’re layered abstractions, inspired by Léger and Matisse, built from a base of inkjet print reproductions of day to day objects to become something surreal and strange.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Milan-based Pietro Roccasalva showed <a href="http://www.massimodecarlo.com/exhibitions/view/12096?&amp;lang=eng">a set of paintings of total Italianness</a> at Massimo De Carlo (which seems to be sharing its premises with a high-end carpet dealer?): based on a film still from the Pasolini movie <em>La Ricotta’</em>, and often featuring what looks very much like Morandi’s white bottle.</p>
<p>I loved conceptual artist and ex Marina Abramovic paramour Ulay’s <a href="https://www.richardsaltoun.com/exhibitions/67/overview/">fun “polaroid paintings”</a> at Richard Saltoun, and, to bookend the week with more Germanness, was baffled by ￼André Butzer’s <a href="https://www.maxhetzler.com/exhibitions/andre-butzer-1-eis-bitte-1999-2018/press-en/">“science fiction expressionism”</a> at Max Hetzler’s new London space.</p>
<p><em>Jörg Immendorff: Questions from a Painter Who Reads is at Michael Werner (London). 16 November 2018 - 25 January 2019</em></p>
