    <h1>Sanya Kantarovsky &amp; Camille Blatrix: Will-o’-the-wisp | Modern Art</h1>

    <p>I’ve loved Sanya Kantarovsky’s snarky, morbid and scatological paintings since I first encountered them, in his <a href="https://artangled.com/kantarovsky-kunsthalle">2018 solo show at Kunsthalle Basel</a>. So I was really excited to see <a href="https://modernart.net/exhibitions/sanya-kantarovsky-and-camille-blatrix">this London show of his woodblock prints</a>, set in frames from French painter/sculptor Camille Blatrix.</p>
<p>The thing that struck me about Kantarovsky’s work, then and now, is the balance between the serious and the silly. These prints have hideous subject matter - in one, a robed, bloodied figure kneels by the surf; in another, a child and his mother are molested by a bony hand - but are cartoonishly-drawn, in zanily bright colours. That poor wounded man is watched by a perky seagull. And there’s something funny about that molesting hand’s absurdly long fingers, each knucklebone popping out like a toffee apple on a stick.</p>

<p>It’s a creepily absorbing fairy tale, with both artists contributing to the atmosphere. In Basel, Kantarovsky used a wide range of source material, from his own childhood trauma to Yves Klein’s blues to Bulgakov’s fantasy classic <em>The Master and Margerita</em>. This time around, the images seem to come direct from his own imagination.</p>
<p>Blatrix’s spotless white plastic frames are hinged, meaning the prints pop out at angles. According to the show notes, they’re intended to look like a bivalve shell, and will be moved around during the exhibition’s run. The Frenchman works in marquetry, and his painted wood can be seen through holes in the plastic.</p>
<p>This way, the two artists work together towards a whole: two staring, elongated eyes regard the figure on the beach; another shadowy pair (Kantarovsky) is accompanied by a blue-flamed candle (Blatrix).</p>

<p>The combination is deeply satisfying. Two like minds are joined across the ocean: Kantarovsky was born in Russia, but is based in New York; Blatrix lives and works in Paris. What a nice pair of considerable talents to encounter, back in the west end for a Mayfair gallery binge after lockdown.</p>
