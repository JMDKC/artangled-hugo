    <h1>Phantastisch! Alfred Kubin und der Blaue Reiter | Lenbachhaus</h1>

    <p>Alfred Kubin had a pretty standard upbringing, when you consider his predilection for the grotesque. Bouncing between mental health problems, a sexual encounter with a pregnant woman when he was 11, and a (failed) suicide-by-shotgun attempt on his mother’s grave, he found lasting fame just after graduating with sickly macabre little pen-and-ink drawings, depicting torture, devils, and death. There’s a great selection on show at <a href="https://www.lenbachhaus.de/ausstellungen/phantastisch-alfred-kubin-und-der-blaue-reiter/">Phantastisch! Alfred Kubin und Der Blaue Reiter</a>, an exhibition currently running at the Lenbachhaus in Munich.</p>
<p>I found the work pictured below, <em>Macht</em> (or, <em>Power</em>), the most disturbing of all. A huge powerful sea lion triumphantly lords it over a huge pile of skulls - bird, mammal and possibly human. A mass murderer, now at the top of the heap. And proud of it.</p>
<p><img src="/kubin-lenbachhaus.jpg" alt="Installation view"></p>
<p>The first couple of rooms of the exhibition are much the strongest. They deal with his pen-and-ink drawings, made between the end of the 19th century and 1904.</p>
<p>Kubin’s story was that he was inspired to draw these scenes in visions, which were themselves inspired by the etchings of Max Klinger. He has a more famous precedent in Goya, who also painted from visions. And the Austrian artist’s drawings had a powerful influence on later masters of the macabre. It’s impossible not to see a hint of Tim Burton’s <em>Nightmare Before Christmas</em> in his strange creatures and scenes. There are also murmurings of his Expressionist peers of <em>Die Brücke</em> up in Berlin.</p>
<p>On show at the Lenbachhaus, Kubin&rsquo;s sick scenes include a pair of gravediggers, a <em>Sucking Creature</em> - an octopus digging its tentacles into a zombified woman’s head - the shadowy desert ritual of <em>Incantation</em>, and <em>A Tortured Man</em>, looking very much like Kubin himself, squatting naked and firing out a stupendous cable of shit, as a pair of thugs beat him around the head.</p>
<p><img src="/kubin-lenbachhaus-2.jpg" alt="Installation view"></p>
<p>But, as the title of the exhibition suggests, Kubin was associated - later in his career - with Kandinsky, Münter and the rest of the <em>Blaue Reiter</em> movement, contributing a few drawings to their almanac. On superficial inspection, he doesn’t seem to have much in common with their light-filled, joyfully kinetic paintings. Though he did work more in watercolours, and in a larger format, after the early pen-and-ink period.</p>
<p>None of Kubin’s later work - he lived quietly through World War Two, made a living as a book illustrator and died in 1959 - really has the same force as the early drawings. They define him. And, while they portray bad things, that’s no bad thing.</p>
<h3 id="other-highlights">Other Highlights</h3>
<p>As I was on holiday, it was a bit of an art orgy this week, so what follow isn’t quite a complete list of the shows I saw in Munich.</p>
<p><img src="/kubin-lenbachhaus-3.jpg" alt="Installation view"></p>
<p>Best introduction to an artist that was new to me was <a href="http://www.galeriewittenbrink.de/exhibition.html">Tom Fecht at Galerie Wittenbrink</a>. He’s an ex engineer who took colour photographs of the sea during a total eclipse, and didn’t do any retouching after: leading to some very cool images.</p>
<p>I was a bit baffled by <a href="https://hausderkunst.de/en/exhibitions/joerg-immendorff">Jörg Immendorff at the Haus der Kunst,</a> though for me any artist described as having a “close personal relationship with Joseph Beuys” is a warning sign. Immendorff’s huge acrylic paint works seemed like pure kitsch to me. Also firmly in the “do not get” column is Cy Twombly, whose <a href="http://www.museum-brandhorst.de/en/exhibitions/cy-twombly-in-the-studio.html">world-beating collection at Museum Brandhorst</a> seemed as po-faced and inscrutable as ever.</p>
<p>I enjoyed a group show of female artists’ video installations - including Pipilotti Rist’s hilarious <em>Pimple Porno</em> from the early 90s. This was <a href="https://hausderkunst.de/en/exhibitions/generations-part-2-kuenstlerinnen-im-dialog-sammlung-goetz-im-haus-der-kunst-1">at the Sammlung Goetz</a>, currently located in an air raid shelter - with each cubicle shut off with a curtain and hosting a different video. Very cool! Also at the Haus der Kunst was <em><a href="https://hausderkunst.de/en/exhibitions/vivan-sundaram-disjunctures">Disjunctures</a></em>, a retrospective of Indian artist Vivan Sundaram. The highlight there was the amazingly sinister <em>12 bed ward</em>: bed frames with mattresses of rubber soles, lit by bare bulbs.</p>
<p>At the Pinakothek der Moderne I saw <a href="https://www.pinakothek.de/en/exhibitions/architecture-under-king-ludwig-ii-palaces-and-factories">an informative exhibition about Ludwig II</a> - the mad gay king with the fairytale castles - and his urban planning. Dialling back 100 years in homosexual history, there was a<a href="https://www.antike-am-koenigsplatz.mwn.de/de/staatliche-antiken-sammlungen-muenchen/sonderausstellungen/tod-in-triest.html">n uninformative exhibition at the Staatliche Antikensammlungen</a> about the 1765 death of classical scholar JJ Winckelmann: if there was any mention that his murder in Trieste was by trade, it was in German and I didn’t spot it.</p>
<p>At the commercial galleries, I saw Peter Wüthrich’s <a href="https://susanboutwell.com/art/?id=13921">imaginative reformatting of book dust jackets</a> at Susan Boutwell, and saw Welsh artist Bethan Hughes various pencil-on-paper tributes to Marcel Duchamp at <a href="http://www.barbaragross.de/exhibitions/">a ho-hum show at Barbara Gross</a>. Much cooler was Andreas Chatwal’s black-glazed ceramics over the road <a href="http://galerie-jovandeloo.com/exhibition/various-others">at Jo van de Loo</a>.</p>
<p>At Galerie Thomas, there was <a href="https://www.galerie-thomas.de/detail-exhibitions-gtm-en/bernd-zimmer-en.html">an ultra-colourful Bernd Zimmer retrospective</a> - huge paintings showing stars in various states of supernova - and <a href="https://www.galerie-thomas.de/detail-exhibitions-gt-en/expressionists-prints-and-emil-nolde-12-x-prints.html">some <em>Die Brücke</em> prints</a>, including a few from my favourite, Emil Nolde.</p>
<p>I also saw the permanent collections at the state museums, and if I had to shout one work out that made me gasp in shock and awe, it’d be Rogier van der Weyden’s <em>Columba</em> altarpiece, just for being so breathtakingly, unbelievably intricate. I’ll have a hard time forgetting the teeming life in the medieval Flemish town in the background of this large triptych, outshining the Virgin and saints in the foreground.</p>
