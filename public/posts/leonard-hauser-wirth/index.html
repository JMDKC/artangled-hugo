    <h1>Zoe Leonard. Aerials | Hauser &amp; Wirth</h1>

    <p>Zoe Leonard is an American conceptual artist who took aerial photos of New York City over several years in the late 80s. Gelatin silver prints of these <a href="https://www.hauserwirth.com/hauser-wirth-exhibitions/22454-zoe-leonard">are on show as Hauser &amp; Wirth</a> right now, and when I went to see them, I basically wanted to buy them all, in an alternative fantasy universe where I actually have the funds to do that.</p>
<p>The artist’s eye gets caught on urban infrastructure; the densely gridded street pattern of the city; worn summer baseball fields, packed back to back and encroached on by houses from all sides; and, most lovingly shot of all, a gleaming rail interchange, the iron and wood of the parallel tracks caught by low light, rendered mysterious by the silver print’s blur. I looked at this wonderful, inscrutable photograph, untitled like most of the others in the show, for a long time.</p>
<p><img src="/leonard-hauser-wirth-1.jpg" alt="Leonard"></p>
<p>Elsewhere, there are a couple of less interesting nature shots: a meander of a river, shot twice, each time abstracted by a slight motion blur.</p>
<p>Leonard isn’t trying to be polemical, or impose any humanity on the man-made urban landscapes she depicts. (A tension I’ve noticed in other artists featured here previously, such as <a href="http://artangled.com/2018/02/25/gursky-hayward/">Andreas Gursky</a> and <a href="http://artangled.com/2018/02/18/sironi-estorick/">Mario Sironi</a>.) But even so, I was moved by the serenity of her literally elevated perspective: the urban realm, grimy and messy at ground level, revealing hidden patterns and symmetries when shot from a great height.</p>
<h3 id="other-highlights">Other Highlights</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.condocomplex.org/london/">Condo 2019</a> opened this week in London, and I visited its Cork Street Galleries hub: standouts for me there were Dickon Drury’s gaudy Dutch landscapes and Gili Tal’s fun pretend office doormats.</p>
<p><img src="/leonard-hauser-wirth-2.jpg" alt="Lorenzato"></p>
<p>Amadeo Luciano Lorenzato is a new name for me, but the Brazilian artist’s <a href="https://www.davidzwirner.com/exhibitions/amadeo-luciano-lorenzato">exhibition at David Zwirner</a>, the first outside his native country, was quite lovely. It features gem-like, and very small, oil on board paintings - using similar techniques to early Renaissance greats Cimabue and Masaccio, who inspired Lorenzato - but this time depicting landscapes of scenes from his home town, Belo Horizonte.</p>
<p>A couple of crowd-pleasers next. <a href="https://www.blainsouthern.com/exhibitions/me-somewhere-else">Chiharu Shiota: Me Somewhere Else</a> makes complex, precisely-patterned yarn works, and there’s a spectacular room-sized one at Blain Southern. Meanwhile, Martin Creed is making <a href="https://www.hauserwirth.com/hauser-wirth-exhibitions/22509-martin-creed-toast">many, many visual jokes at Hauser &amp; Wirth</a>.</p>
<p>Also at Blain Southern, there’s some <a href="https://www.blainsouthern.com/exhibitions/schlagen-und-bleiben">uncanny pencil portraits from Jonas Burgert</a>, while his compatriot David Ostrowski has <a href="http://www.spruethmagers.com/exhibitions/485">a show organised around the colour red</a> at Spreuth Magers.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed Jedd Novatt’s stainless steel <em>Chaos</em> sculptures of various sizes - kind of like frameworks of under-construction skyscrapers - <a href="https://www.waddingtoncustot.com/exhibitions/122/">at Waddington Custot</a>, while <a href="https://www.alminerech.com/exhibitions/5353-todd-bienvenu">Todd Bienvenu at Almine Rech</a> had the funniest show notes: the American painter’s deliberately crude acrylic on canvas paintings of bikinis, bike crashes and swimming pools could definitely be summed up as “hungover Hockney”.</p>
<p>Bienvenu reminded me a lot of Eric Fischl, and kudos to him for giving us two painted explorations of a very modern light source: people’s faces being lit up by their phone screens in the dark.</p>
<p>Finally, if you ever wanted to find out what Godard’s <em>Le mépris</em> looks like with Brigitte Bardot digitally removed, you can find out in <a href="https://www.thomasdanegallery.com/exhibitions/213/works/">Amie Siegel’s show at Thomas Dane</a>, which features exactly that video work. I also found out there that the 1963 movie had an alternative soundtrack for the Italian market. It’s an absurd, pornified counterpoint to Georges Delerue’s famous tune for the rest-of-world version.</p>
