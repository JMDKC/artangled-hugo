    <h1>Beth Letain - Signal Hill | PACE</h1>

    <p>Beth Letain&rsquo;s influences range from Giorgio Morandi to Agnes Martin, though her deliberately ultra-simple forms are more abstract than either, and with a far bolder use of colour. The colours of these big paintings, <a href="https://www.pacegallery.com/exhibitions/12938/signal-hill">currently on show at PACE</a>, are deep, bold and matte. Their surfaces, prepared by layers of homemade gesso, have a luxurious sheen.</p>
<p>My favourite was &lsquo;Strong Winds&rsquo;, its bold horizontality and almost hallucinatory depth was the most directly evocative of the exhibition&rsquo;s title: &lsquo;Signal Hill&rsquo; is the hill from which the first morse code was received.</p>
<p><img src="/letain-pace.jpg" alt="Installation view"></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an unpretentious name for a momentous event. And Letain&rsquo;s art is similarly bare and unadorned. The (excellent) show notes refer to the &ldquo;infinity bands&rdquo; of her paintings, the slashes of colour extending right to the edge of the frameless canvases. There&rsquo;s the suggestion that the works we see only contain a fraction of the whole; that these colours will go on forever, remaining just as bold and strong.</p>
<p>Unusually, the window blinds at PACE are rolled up, bathing the space in hazy summer light. There&rsquo;s a new side-door to the recently-opened Royal Academy extension that should also increase footfall - a nice compensation for the gallery entrance having been accessible through the building works for what seems like years.</p>
<p>The large room&rsquo;s new found permeability matches the space, and possibilities, of Letain&rsquo;s canvases.</p>
<p><em>Beth Letain: Signal Hill is at PACE (London). 28 June - 4 August 2018.</em></p>
