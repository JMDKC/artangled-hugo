    <h1>Always Drawing - José Antonio Suárez Londoño | Ordovas</h1>

    <p>This Colombian artist must be a gallerist’s dream: his tiny, ornate pen and ink drawings, arranged <a href="https://www.ordovasart.com/exhibition/always-drawing/">in this exhibition</a> in attractive rows, are deeply pretty, crafty and uplifting. Each features a tiny stamp proving ownership, just for that little extra bit of covetability; the artist, cultivating the brand, likes to be known just as “JASL”.</p>
<p>There are 100 drawings in all, along with 50 etchings, covering most of the smallish gallery. Repeated themes? Steam ships, maps and abstract patterns.</p>

<p>Suárez Londoño studied biology in his native city of Medellín (in one of the world’s <a href="http://discovercolombia.com/university-of-antioquia/">all-time prettiest campuses</a>), and there’s something of the scientist’s eye in the diagram-like depictions of animals and body parts. Even though he’s generous in the range of materials used - from charcoal to carefully delineated tea stains - there’s no false move, no loss of control.</p>
<p>With great craft comes relentless discipline. Suárez Londoño draws daily, and doesn’t own a computer.</p>
<p><em>Always Drawing - José Antonio Suárez Londoño is at Ordovas (London). June 7 - August 3 2019</em></p>
