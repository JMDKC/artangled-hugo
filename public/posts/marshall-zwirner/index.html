    <h1>Kerry James Marshall - History of Painting  | David Zwirner</h1>

    <p>Kerry James Marshall is uber-influential these days, with his works selling for seven figure sums - to P Diddy, no less. He&rsquo;s also an incredible and sensitive portraitist. Sometimes beloved, successful work is great work, as his <a href="https://www.davidzwirner.com/exhibitions/history-painting">new exhibition at David Zwirner</a> proves. But the show also has interesting things to say about the nature of that success.</p>
<p>This is an exhibition about the ways in which paintings can be made, and the contexts in which they are received. There are three groups of works: splotchy abstracts, images of huge auction prices from 2007 - from just before the crisis - and, what everyone&rsquo;s really come to see, a series of amazingly evocative portraits.</p>
<p><img src="/marshall-zwirner.jpg" alt="Installation view"></p>
<p>The last set really leap out for their gorgeously bold use of acrylic paint throughout, but especially on black skin. They&rsquo;re replete with adorable, satisfying details. Look at the dog walker above - and note that her bright turquoise nail polish matches her shoes. And there&rsquo;s a real showstopper, a massive diptych called &lsquo;Untitled (Underpainting)&rsquo;, a scene at an imaginary art museum where the patrons and guides are all black.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don’t see images of black people in trauma in my work; you don’t see images of black people who are abject in my work,&rdquo; <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7f16afe4-c6ed-11e8-ba8f-ee390057b8c9">he told the Financial Times recently</a>. In the history of art, he points out, &ldquo;we don’t think of black people and joy&rdquo;.</p>
<p>With the - surely intentionally bad - abstracts and the auction prices, Marshall contextualises his black bodies with the hard finances and fads of the art world. And he comes out on top!</p>
<h3 id="other-highlights">Other highlights</h3>
<p>I saw the goofy <a href="http://www.spruethmagers.com/exhibitions/483">Lucy Dodd: Miss Mars</a>, with the works&rsquo; materials ranging from tobacco to &ldquo;dragon&rsquo;s blood&rdquo; at Sprüth Magers. I saw mirrors of all kinds at the stylish <a href="http://mazzoleniart.com/elenco_espositori/michelangelo-pistoletto-origins-and-consequences/">Michelangelo Pistoletto: Origins &amp; Consequences</a>, at Mazzoleni, where a special shout-out goes to his black mirror.</p>
<p>There were monochrome, Duchamp-referencing <a href="http://lglondon.org/index.php/current/">Olivier Mosset: Graphic Works</a> at Laure Genillard, and a theme-free group show - <a href="http://www.sprovieri.com/london/pedro-cabrita-reis-jimmie-durham-cildo-meireles/">Pedro Cabrita Reis Jimmie Durham Cildo Meireles</a> at Sprovieri.</p>
<p>More pretentious was <a href="https://www.luxembourgdayan.com/exhibitions/61/press_release_text/">Sublime Hardware</a> at Luxembourg &amp; Dayan, pairing Pino Pascoli&rsquo;s model tank with a Dan Flavin work with white neon lights. (I&rsquo;m grouchy because the tank was taped off like it was showing at the Tate, rather than a down-at-heel first floor gallery in a Mayfair back street.)</p>
<p>Things improved with <a href="https://www.frithstreetgallery.com/exhibitions/daniel-silver">Daniel Silver at Frith Street Gallery</a>, and his gorgeous mannequins and oryx and marble sculptures. Plaster and wood were the primary materials at a small <a href="http://tenderpixel.com/exhibitions/something-infinitely-distant-and-strange">Florian Roithmayr show at Tenderpixel</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, I saw Luke William Thompson&rsquo;s moving and immersive video work at <a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/turner-prize-2018">Turner Prize 2018</a> at Tate Britain - he&rsquo;s my tip for the win.</p>
<p><em>Kerry James Marshall: History of Painting is at David Zwirner (London). 03 October - 10 November 2018</em></p>
