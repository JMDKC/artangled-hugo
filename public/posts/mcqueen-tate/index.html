    <h1>Steve McQueen - Year 3 | Tate Britain</h1>

    <p>Steve McQueen <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-50901526">was made a knight in the 2020 honours list</a>, and this is just the kind of public-spirited artwork suitable for such a high national honour. (Though I can’t help thinking LS Lowry’s approach of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_who_have_declined_a_British_honour">turning down such Royal-approved baubles</a>, all the way up to refusing the Companion of Honour twice, is a much cooler artistic statement.)</p>
<p>For <a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/steve-mcqueen-year-3">this exhibition</a>, specially-trained Tate teams have photographed a total of 76,000 of London’s Year 3 schoolchildren and teachers in the traditional class photo format. These pictures have taken over the entire massive Duveen Gallery at Tate Britain - with photos all the way up the walls. Each participating school is told by the gallery where exactly their photo is; if it’s too high, assistants have special large magnifiers on wheels to help viewers of all heights get a closer look.</p>

<p>Why? “There’s an urgency to reflect on who we are and our future,” McQueen said. “To have a visual reflection on the people who make this city work. I think it’s important and in some ways urgent.”</p>
<p>The signs of utility, making it work, rather than beauty in these photos are deeply poignant. I found the tightly-repeating sets of shabby parquet floors and knackered wall bars, dioramas, and, especially, the gym benches on which so many children and teachers perched - nostalgia-inducing and moving.</p>
<p><img src="/mcqueen-tate-2.jpg" alt="installation view"></p>
<p>I thought of one boy in particular, head resting trustingly on his teacher’s shoulder. The massive diversity of faces. And, with my increasingly crotchety age, above all, I saw what Philip Larkin once termed “<em><a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/48418/sad-steps">the strength and pain / of being young</a></em>”; these young Londoners beam and glower at the Tate photographers, and at us, unmarked by life, with its short grey winter days.</p>
<p>All that from some class photos! Give that man the Companion of Honour. I’m sure he will, quite rightly, accept it.</p>
