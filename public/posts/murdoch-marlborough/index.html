    <h1>Nina Murdoch - Collecting Colour | Marlborough Fine Arts</h1>

    <p>Nina Murdoch paints with egg tempera on gesso. Her works main show abstracted scenes of buildings and pathways. Some of the paintings <a href="http://www.marlboroughlondon.com/exhibitions/nina-murdoch-collecting-colour/">in this show</a>, with their endless layerings and scrapings, take years to produce.</p>
<p>To me, they had the irresistably evocative atmosphere of a rainy London evening - evocative maybe because that was exactly the atmosphere outside of the gallery, when I wandered in ten minutes before closing. <em>Path</em>, pictured below, which took three years, drew me in, with its lights banding as if they were seen from a slow-moving car.</p>

<p>She&rsquo;s said to work in &ldquo;abstract Baroque&rdquo;, whatever that means. Maybe it refers to the depth of craft necessary to create these pools of shining orangey-yellow light that puncture the murk, just like an old, pre-LCD streetlight. Maybe it&rsquo;s their appeal to the infinite and the unknown. Or maybe it&rsquo;s their slightly stately grandeur.</p>
<p>Looking closely, I tried to discern architectural details in the paintings, and the mini-replicas in pastels at the back of the gallery. In the end, I gave up and enjoyed them from a distance, as I was supposed to.</p>

<p>I also saw <a href="https://www.pacegallery.com/exhibitions/12958/our-ideas">Adam Pendleton: Our Ideas</a> at PACE	London, where I was pretty baffled by the artist&rsquo;s idea of &ldquo;Black Dada&rdquo;. I was actively annoyed by <a href="https://www.mayorgallery.com/m/exhibitions/535/overview/">Mario Schifano: Compagni, compagni, 1968</a> at The Mayor Gallery, with spray paint on perspex prints depicting hammer-and-sickle wielding protesters (each going for at least £180k). There&rsquo;s more 60s Italy at <a href="https://www.robilantvoena.com/exhibitions/185/">Pietro Consagra: Frontal Sculptures 1947-67</a> from Robilant &amp; Voena, the welded aluminium disks hanging from the ceiling totally evocative of that decade. I could imagine one on David Hemmings&rsquo; wall in <em>Blow-Up</em>.</p>
<p>I caught the last day of the <a href="https://www.hauserwirth.com/hauser-wirth-exhibitions/19622-zeng-fanzhi-london">Zeng Fanzhi show at Hauser &amp; Wirth</a> - and was glad I did, considering the artist&rsquo;s amazing mastery of colour and form. (Best work was his reproductions of Victor Hugo&rsquo;s deathmask, against absolutely raw canvas.) <a href="https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibition/klimt-schiele">Klimt/Schiele at the Royal Academy</a> was a logistical challenge more than anything else as it was so packed, but it was a seriously high-wattage collection of drawings from the pair of Austrian bad boys. Maybe a bit too bad in places, such as the livid red labia of one of Schiele&rsquo;s clearly underage subjects.</p>
<p>Michael Landy is showing compacted cubes of previous artworks <a href="https://www.thomasdanegallery.com/artists/43-michael-landy/exhibitions/">at Thomas Dane Gallery</a>, while I was introduced by Léon Wuidar&rsquo;s <a href="https://whitecube.com/exhibitions/exhibition/leon_wuidar_inside_the_white_cube_2018">uber-precise, Brutalist architecture-inspired paintings</a> at White Cube.</p>
