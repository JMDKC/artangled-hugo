    <h1>Xie Nanxing - A Gift Like Kung Pao Chicken | Thomas Dane Gallery</h1>

    <p>This show wasn’t exactly appealing to me as I can’t stand the volcanically spicy Sichuan dish it’s named after, but Xie Nanxing soon put my prejudices (and stomach) to rest. The  <a href="https://www.thomasdanegallery.com/exhibitions/220/works/">reason for the name</a>  is the bright colours of kung pao chicken, and accordingly the walls of Thomas Dane are painted in greens and pinks.</p>
<p>The similarities to the chicken dish end there. Xie’s painting technique is known as ‘canvas print’. It involves putting a wash of colour on a canvas, put another canvas on top, and then paint figuratively, pressing hard, so that the human figures are transposed to the lower canvas in little stipples, and as ghostly outlines.</p>
<p><img src="/nanxing-dane-1.jpg" alt="installation view"></p>
<p>The figurative work is deliberately derivative: the inspiration in the pink work above is Richter’s nude on a staircase, as well as Burne-Jones’ spiral staircase (on display at the Tate Britain retrospective  <a href="http://artangled.com/2019/01/06/burne-jones-tate/">I wrote about earlier this year</a> ).</p>
<p>This series as a whole is called <em>Spices</em>, though the colours and textures seemed more like ice cream: sweet, mild and addictive. Xie lives and works in his native China, and will hopefully get a bigger show in this country soon.</p>
<p><em>Xie Nanxing: A Gift Like Kung Pao Chicken is at Thomas Dane Gallery (London). June 06 - July 27 2009</em></p>
