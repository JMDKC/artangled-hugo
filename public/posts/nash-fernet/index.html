    <h1>David Nash - Nature to Nature | Fondation Fernet-Branca</h1>

    <p>Loosely associated with the Chelsea school when young, David Nash now works in darkest Wales. And he works with wood. Wood, in all its forms - burnt into charcoal, cut into columns, melded into stacks - is the basis of all the works <a href="http://fondationfernet-branca.org/david-nash-nature-to-nature/">in this show</a>, taking up most of this former distillery in Alsace, near the Swiss border.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the sculptures that stand out here, in which Nash imposes a regularity and elegance onto what&rsquo;s organic and wild. The show climaxes with a room in which all the wooden sculptures are burnt black: towering over the others is a 3.5 metre tall pair, <em>King and Queen</em>, from 2011.</p>
<p><img src="/nash-fernet.jpg" alt="Installation view"></p>
<p>Nash makes these sculptures with the crudest of tools: a chainsaw and an axe. There&rsquo;s something of the violence of creation, cutting the wood and then burning it, in these huge black sentinels.</p>
<p>More kindly is Nash&rsquo;s land work. His most famous, <a href="https://www.christies.com/features/David-Nash-on-his-free-range-sculpture-Wooden-Boulder-7525-1.aspx"><em>Wooden Boulder</em></a>, represented by a photo series in the final room of the Fondation Fernet-Branca show, saw Nash carve a large wooden ball, leave it in the Welsh woods, and photograph its progress over the years. This &ldquo;free range sculpture&rdquo; was tracked by Nash for 35 years, before it was finally swept away in heavy rains in 2015.</p>
<p>Just goes to show. You can master nature by cutting and burning, but, eventually, it will take back control.</p>

<p>Nearby, I went to the <a href="https://www.vitra.com/en-gb/campus">Vitra Campus in Weil am Rhein</a>, a bizarre (but wonderful) architectural wonderland, featuring Zaha Hadid&rsquo;s first building - a fire station - and local boys Herzog &amp; de Meuron&rsquo;s Schaudepot, in which, among a lot else, is the Eames archive. And a reproduction of the Eamses disappointingly grotty offices.</p>
