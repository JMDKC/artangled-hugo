    <h1>Nunzio - The Shock of Objectivity | Mazzoleni</h1>

    <p>I found <a href="http://mazzoleniart.com/elenco_espositori/nunzio-the-shock-of-objectivity/">this show</a> spectacular but a bit inscrutable. It’s summed up - though maybe not in the way the curator, Kenneth Baker, intended - by the artist’s own quote from the show notes: “When you are confronted with the work of art, either you feel that it is it, or it leaves you soulless.”</p>
<p>On entering the Mazzoleni gallery, behind one of Mayfair’s less functional doorbells and beyond one of its less populated front desks, I was confronted by the spectacular in search of a soul: <em>Avvoltoio</em>, meaning ‘vulture’, a new work, free-standing and grand, made out of burnt wood.</p>
<p><img src="/nunzio-mazzoleni-1.jpg" alt="installation view"></p>
<p>The feathery boards are simultaneously light (in weight) and dark in colour, organically irregular but forming a neat pattern, scrolling and unfurling across the floor like a pair of wings. It’s an impressive object in search of a meaning; craft in search of style.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, there are a range of wall works, incorporating lead as well as burnt wood. I wonder though what Nunzio provides the viewer, what’s new, what’s not been done. I’m thinking of his compatriot Burri’s first, and angriest, <a href="http://artangled.com/2018/12/09/oehlen-hetzler/">charred canvases, from half a century earlier</a>. Or whether the <a href="http://artangled.com/2018/03/11/pistoletto-simon-lee/">arte povera group</a>, from a couple of decades later - but still several decades ago - did more inventive and arresting things with metal. Nunzio works in Turin, home of arte povera. Does he look at that group and compare himself with them?</p>
<p>I liked looking at that burnt-black vulture, trapped, crouching ominously and craggily in the cool gallery space. Then I forgot it, remembering it again as I write. I thought about its soul, whether it has one, or whether I just couldn’t see it.</p>
<p>Then I realised I&rsquo;d misunderstood Nunzio&rsquo;s words. In the quote from the show notes, he&rsquo;s talking about whether the <em>viewer</em> feels &ldquo;soulless&rdquo; after the work of art, not whether the art lacks soul. And the confusion just deepened.</p>
