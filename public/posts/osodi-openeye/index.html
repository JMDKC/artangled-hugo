    <h1>George Osodi - Nigerian Monarchs | Open Eye Gallery</h1>

    <p>Long before the first British colonist set foot on the land, Nigeria was a country of Kingdoms. Kings (and Queens) managed diplomacy between their small fiefdoms. They were stripped of their diplomatic function by colonial rule: a function that was not reinstated post-independence in the 1960s. But many local monarchs still survive, with not much more than fine clothes, accoutrements and a handful of subjects to show for their rank.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the message of <a href="https://openeye.org.uk/whatson/liverpool-biennial-2018-beautiful-world-where-are-you/">this photographic exhibition from George Osodi</a>, part of the Liverpool Biannale that&rsquo;s going on this summer. All of his kings and queens are photographed face-on. All look very regal, and show extreme extravagance in clothing.</p>
<p><img src="/osodi-openeye.jpg" alt="Installation view"></p>
<p>But then again, small details bring the groups back down to earth. Plastic rosary beads are draped around one fine backdrop. A handsome throne is gold painted wood, rather than precious metals. Some of the floors could do with a good sweep. Some of the regalia is frayed. Framed photos flanking one monarch are askew.</p>
<p>Happily, Osodi is not interested in patronisingly underlining the absurd contrast between a finely-dressed monarch and their lack of actual power. His eye is respectful, delighting in the subject&hellip; as a subject. &ldquo;I wanted the Kings project to show the richness of the Kings in their elegance
and fashions, which are diverse, changing from one kingdom to another,&rdquo; <a href="https://www.theransomnote.com/culture/articles/george-osodi-nigerian-monarchs/.">he told one interviewer</a>.</p>
<p>Exactly. However powerful they are - or aren&rsquo;t - the clothes are great.</p>
