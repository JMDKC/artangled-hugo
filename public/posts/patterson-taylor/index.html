    <h1>Richard Patterson: Only Fans | Timothy Taylor</h1>

    <p>Richard Patterson was a YBA, part of the scandalous 1990s <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m001cbsr">‘Sensation’ generation</a>. But, like his peers <a href="/tags/gillian-wearing">Gillian Wearing</a> and <a href="/tags/gavin-turk">Gavin Turk</a>, he’s matured into a painter of sensitivity and skill. Proof of this view comes in ‘<a href="https://www.timothytaylor.com/exhibitions/richard-patterson_2023/">Only Fans</a>’, a show of small-format works using what the press release describes as a “carnal palette”, which closed this week at Timothy Taylor.</p>
<p>All 13 paintings in the exhibition are dreamy swirls of flesh-toned roses and ochres, on luxurious-looking linen canvas. They’re somehow deeply textured and flat at the same time, an optical illusion that comes from Patterson using a wet-on-wet technique: painting a layer of different-coloured oil paint while the previous layer is still wet.</p>
<p><img src="/images/patterson-taylor-1.jpeg" alt="Richard Patterson &amp;lsquo;Delaunay&amp;rsquo; (2022)"></p>
<p>Step back, and in many of the works you can just about make out the shadowy form of a lounging woman - sometimes her face, sometimes her curvaceous butt. &lsquo;Delaunay&rsquo; (2022), pictured above, is a good example. The exhibition’s title, the name of a pay-for-porn website, helps us make sense of what we&rsquo;re seeing: naked flesh, mediated by layers of digital-looking distortion. An illusion of intimacy.</p>
<p>Tricksy representations of online porn are employed quite a bit by artists these days - I’m thinking in particular of a <a href="https://www.crousel.com/en/article/wade-guyton-natural-wine-2019/">Wade Guyton show</a> I saw a couple of years back, that made sly use of inkjet prints from XVideos (OnlyFans for the hard-up).</p>
<p>But while Guyton went for the shock factor, there’s nothing explicit about Patterson’s work, really. In fact, it’s their withholding nature that makes these small, lush, fleshy paintings so memorable.</p>
<p><em>Richard Patterson: Only Fans is at Timothy Taylor (London). 11 March - 15 April 2023</em></p>
