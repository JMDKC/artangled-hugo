    <h1>Grayson Perry: Posh Cloths | Victoria Miro</h1>

    <p>Grayson Perry’s been making a multi-media attack on the idea of Englishness over recent years. In 2019, Perry had an exhibition of pots on this theme <a href="https://www.victoria-miro.com/exhibitions/547/">at Victoria Miro’s Mayfair space in 2019</a>. Most recently, there&rsquo;s <a href="https://online.victoria-miro.com/grayson-perry-london-venice-2023/">this exhibition of textile works</a>, and a TV show called <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/26/grayson-perry-full-english-review-comes-dangerously-close-to-tainting-the-artists-brand">Grayson Perry’s Full English</a></em>.  In both, Perry pokes at, and sometimes celebrates, English people&rsquo;s sense of themselves.</p>
<p>I said the exhibition had &ldquo;textile works&rdquo;, but these particular posh cloths are actually tapestries. Posh, because tapestries tend to hang in stately homes. What’s on these particular machine-stitched tapestries though? Scenes from today’s England which are far from stately.</p>
<p><img src="/perry-miro-1.jpeg" alt="Grayson Perry, &amp;lsquo;Battle of Britain&amp;rsquo; (2017)"></p>
<p><em>Battle of Britain</em>, from 2017 and pictured above, sums it up. The landscape is inspired by Paul Nash&rsquo;s 1941 painting of the same name, updated for our times, when the battle is with ourselves, not some foreign invaders, whatever some of our newspapers might say.</p>
<p>That low, cloudy sky. The shabby terrace houses backing on to a train line, which itself backs onto a more typically bucolic landscape of patchwork fields. The shadow of pollution from factory and motorway. The graffiti: <em>VOTE LEAVE</em>, <em>CLASS WAR</em>. It’s Perry’s artistic sleight of hand that allows him to present such a bleak scene so humorously, even warmly. Maybe it’s the rainbow that blesses the scene, just between a slurry-soaked field and a pestilential swarm of starlings.</p>
<p>My fellow gallery goers enjoyed picking out the familiar details as much as I did. Maybe we particularly enjoyed the bits that poked at <em>our</em> demographic, the kind of people who hike up and down Victoria Miro’s steep staircase on a Saturday afternoon: the Ocado van maybe, or the motorway sign for the Eurotunnel.</p>
<p><img src="/posts/perry-miro-2.jpeg" alt="Grayson Perry, &amp;lsquo;Sacred Tribal Artefact&amp;rsquo; (2023)"></p>
<p>In case that was too subtle, Perry makes his point more clearly in <em>Sacred Tribal Artefact</em>, a new tapestry from this year. A mangy old English lion, flaccid and flatulent, hands over the flag of St George to a young, smartly dressed Black woman.</p>
<p>Yet again, it’s hard not to get affectionately lost in the details on this particular posh cloth. My favourite lay between the lion’s paws on a landscape of rolling, rainbow-like hills stand two towers: 1 Canada Square, the summit of the Canary Wharf business district in London, and a Norman church tower. I’ve somehow resisted saying it so far but… this is England!</p>
<p><em>Grayson Perry: Posh Cloths is at Victoria Miro (London). 03 February - 25 March 2023</em></p>
