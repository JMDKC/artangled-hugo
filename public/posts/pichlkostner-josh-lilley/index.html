    <h1>I Had the Landscape in My Arms | Josh Lilley</h1>

    <p>What an impressive last few months at Josh Lilley! Tucked away on a quiet corner in Fitzrovia, just next to the old Middlesex Hospital site - and its bonkers neo-Byzantine chapel, that I&rsquo;m tempted to write a whole separate post about - this little gallery is on a tear.</p>
<p>Late last year came a knockout show from Philadelphia-based Alex Da Corte. And now, it&rsquo;s a group show of sculpture, using mainly found objects, <a href="http://joshlilleygallery.com/exhibitions/i_had_the_landscape_in_my_arms_2018">with the descriptive title &lsquo;I Had the Landscape in My Arms&rsquo;</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/pichlkostner-josh-lilley.jpg" alt="Installation"></p>
<p>The show includes a couple of US artists, but the set of sculptures that really stood out to me came from Austrian-born, London-based Sarah Pichlkostner.</p>
<p>There are three in all, each with the same (baffling) title: <em>KAY, turned around, KUY, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t stress me, I gonna have a walk now&rdquo;</em>. They&rsquo;re sort of figurative, made mainly of swoops and curves of aluminium. Two of the figures (if that&rsquo;s what they are) are stood on the floor; one&rsquo;s wall-mounted. All three incorporate silverised glass, gravel and dust. The most complex of the set is stood on a neat circular pile of gravel in the middle of the floor. The figures are sinuous, sentry-like. Lightweight but grounded. Urban.</p>
<p>The gallery says the various sculptures represent a means of understanding the &ldquo;landscape of today&rdquo;. To me, these tightly-worked, mysterious objects seemed a concentrated expression of the huge, baffling city surrounding that little corner gallery.</p>
<p><em>I Had the Landscape in My Arms is at Josh Lilley (London). 23 February - 29 March 2018.</em></p>
