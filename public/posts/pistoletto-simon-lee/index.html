    <h1>Michelangelo Pistoletto - Scaffali | Simon Lee Gallery</h1>

    <p>It&rsquo;s OK to be a one-trick pony, if the trick&rsquo;s good enough. Michelangelo Pistoletto is associated with the <em>arte povera</em> movement of Italy in the 1960s, and is famous for his &lsquo;mirror paintings&rsquo;, large wall-mounted mirrors with painted or printed images on them. The first mirror painting dates from the early 60s. And Pistoletto is still at it, judging by <a href="https://www.simonleegallery.com/exhibitions/127/">this show, currently at Simon Lee Gallery</a>.</p>

<p>The dimensions of the mirrors haven&rsquo;t changed much over the decades. This new set, dating from 2014-15, all feature silkscreened images of shelves and their contents. The mirrors include the observer, and it&rsquo;s the uneasy combination of the static image and the moving reflection that generates a slight tension; the distorted image of the watcher over the slightly uneven surface adds to the uncanny feel, if you look long enough.</p>
<p>But any sinister feeling is undercut in the latest work by the deliberate banality of the objects on the shelves: crates of food, art supplies, cheap &lsquo;oriental&rsquo; vases, still with barcode stickers attached. Another with stainless steel canteen cooking urns and utensils. The shelves themselves are similarly utilitarian, metallic, scuffed. The silkscreen transfers - bit of a 60s throwback in itself - is muted, grainy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mirror became the protagonist of my work, in itself,&rdquo; the artist says, in a video accompanying the show. &ldquo;The shelves represent all the sectors of society. The tools of each activity are represented. All that for me became a social engagement - putting together all the details of the society.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s not glory. There&rsquo;s daily life, daily activity, that unites humanity.&rdquo; So, maybe rather than banality - normality, that unites us. Reflected watcher and depicted object, joined by the surface of the mirror.</p>
<p><em>Michelangelo Pistoletto: Scaffali is at Simon Lee Gallery (London). 23 February - 7 April 2018.</em></p>
