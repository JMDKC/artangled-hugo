    <h1>Rembrandt-Velázquez - Dutch &amp; Spanish Masters | Rijksmuseum</h1>

    <p>Talk about star power! Not since <em>Etre moderne</em>, <a href="https://www.fondationlouisvuitton.fr/fr/expositions/exposition/etre-moderne-le-moma-a-paris.html">a “best of MoMA” show that took over the Fondation Louis Vuitton in late 2017</a> while the iconic New York museum was being renovated, have I experienced such concentrated artistic fame in a standalone exhibition.</p>
<p>The concept is simple: a pair of Spanish and Dutch 17th century masterworks, thematically linked, are placed side by side on each wall, in a kind of <a href="https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/rembrandt-velazquez">Godzilla vs Mothra of Baroque mastery</a>. Some of the pairings show inspired lateral thinking on the part of the curators. Early on, there’s a clean, white Sanraedam church interior, next to a trussed Zurbaran lamb. Later, a pairing of Velazquez and Rembrandt’s self portraits - both stares containing their painter’s characteristic psychological penetration.</p>
<p><img src="/rembrandt-rijksmuseum-1.jpg" alt="installation view"></p>
<p>Look over there, and it’s Velazquez’s sweaty scene from <em>Vulcan’s Forge</em>, lined up against Rembrandt’s <em>The Syndics</em>. Then there’s my favourite pairing of all, Vermeer’s deceptively quiet <em>View of Houses in Delft</em> next to Velazquez’s movingly carefree Roman scene, <em>View of the Gardens of the Villa Medici</em>.</p>
<p>The show’s two titular artists, the twin peaks of 17th century western art, never met. Both were preoccupied with status. Both employed world-changingly free brush strokes on their subjects. Both of their home nations were embroiled in a financially ruinous war at the time.</p>
<p>But few of these nuances hit home during the exhibition. Instead, the celebrity of these paintings - a mix of the Rijksmuseum’s permanent collection and some spectacular loans, often from the Prado in Madrid, the partner organisation for this exhibition - overwhelmed everything else. Including this viewer’s ability to focus.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the works on show are less in dialogue with each other than with this viewer. Look at us, they say. You’ve seen us before. Aren’t we important?</p>
<p><em>Rembrandt-Velázquez: Dutch &amp; Spanish Masters is at the Rijksmuseum (Amsterdam). October 11 2019 - January 19 2020</em></p>
