    <h1>Danielle Roberts: Evening All Day | Fredericks &amp; Freiser</h1>

    <p>The portraitist Danielle Roberts, who has <a href="https://www.fredericksfreisergallery.com/exhibitions/danielle-roberts">a show</a> right now at the Fredericks &amp; Freiser gallery, has a lot in common with <a href="/tags/jenna-gribbon">Jenna Gribbon</a> and <a href="/tags/shannon-cartier-lucy">Shannon Cartier Lucy</a>, who I’ve featured on here before. All three painters are young women who paint young women: dramatically lit, listless, filled with ennui.</p>
<p>Roberts’ scenes are generally suburban, and take place at night. One woman is perched with one leg up on the back of a car in a convenience store car park. Another shares a bowl of popcorn on a too-small sofa. Another, less lucky, is locked in a (disappointed-looking) post-coital embrace. Each has a blank, zombie-like stare, static as a Byzantine Virgin Mary. This is all offset by Roberts’ dramatic night-time palette of purples and blues, with highlight passages of brighter pinks and greens.</p>
<p><img src="/roberts-fredericks-freiser-1.jpeg" alt="Danielle Roberts &amp;lsquo;Tethered, Above the Streets Between the Lights&amp;rsquo; (2022)"></p>
<p>The artist must have spent time growing up in these suburban environments (I’m guessing), but now lives in Brooklyn. One work, <em>Tethered, Above the Streets Between the Lights</em> - and I love the melodramatic title - showcases this new home. Two men and a woman are at a party on a rooftop, surrounded by tall buildings and water towers.</p>
<p>(I could write about water towers all day. Those water towers in Roberts’ painting are the same as those lovingly painted by <a href="/tags/edward-hopper">Edward Hopper</a>, featured in his <a href="https://whitney.org/exhibitions/edward-hopper-new-york">massive retrospective on right now at the Whitney</a>. They seem incredibly exotic to me as a European visitor to New York City.)</p>
<p>But Roberts’ morose, zombie-like youth are as unimpressed by their city surroundings. They have their backs to the spectacular skyline - they&rsquo;ve seen it all before. The two men are on their phones, the night glow from their screens just one more source of artificial light. The woman, gripping a beer and staring off to the side, seems uncomfortably suspended on the butt-height roof ledge, rather than sitting on it.</p>
<p>It’s a particularly memorably strange scene, in a show full of them.</p>
