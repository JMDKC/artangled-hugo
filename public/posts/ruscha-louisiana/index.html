    <h1>Ed Ruscha - Very | Louisiana</h1>

    <p>I can&rsquo;t shake the sneaking suspicion that Ed Ruscha&rsquo;s partly to blame for the inspirational quote pictures that are a solid building block of so many Instagram accounts these days. Which is maybe a bit unfair, but at least pays tribute to the range of his influence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s his works on paper, including sketches and a variety of books he&rsquo;s published over the decades, that are <a href="https://en.louisiana.dk/exhibition/ed-ruscha">the focus of this show</a>. At this unbelievably fancy gallery, surrounded by tourists and middle-aged Danish couples in designer glasses and complicated sportswear, the reasons for that influence are laid bare.</p>

<p>His brightly-coloured, wordy prints are what has made Ruscha an icon. But he&rsquo;s a really great draughtsman, too. One gorgeous series that caught my eye is a room full of sketches of one of his favourite subjects: the Hollywood sign. And particularly evocative was a tiny pencil work, of the sign in the rain.</p>
<p>Showing me, at least, that the artist doesn&rsquo;t need the mass-produced prints, or even the colours. He only needs a pencil.</p>
