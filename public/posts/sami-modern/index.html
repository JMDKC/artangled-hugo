    <h1>Mohammed Sami | Modern Art</h1>

    <p><em>The Execution Room</em>, painted by Mohammed Sami, is one of the most impressively ugly artworks I’ve seen in a while. It’s <a href="https://modernart.net/exhibitions/mohammed-sami">currently on show at Modern Art</a>, along with a collection of other new, thematically-linked work from this Iraq-born, Sweden-based artist.</p>
<p>It shows a dining table and chair set in a style that might kindly be termed “dictator chic”. I suspect, but can’t confirm by googling, that it was a room in Saddam Hussein’s palace, captured by allied forces during the disastrous war of 2003. The chintzy chair-backs, shiny table-top and plush patterned carpet are bathed in yellow electric light (the chandelier peeking from the top like the light bulb in Picasso’s <em>Guernica</em>).</p>
<p><img src="/sami-modern-1.jpeg" alt="mohammed sami - &amp;rsquo;the execution room&amp;rsquo;"></p>
<p>But it’s the backdrop that gives the scene a dream like - nightmare-like? - quality. The walls of the room, the curtains, the mirror reflecting the light, are all barely painted in, compared to the carefully-worked textures of the furnishings. They’re bathed in a flat vanilla shade, though part of the wall is underlaid with flatter beiges and greys, the exact colour of a bruise.</p>
<p>At this table, on these grotesque chairs, the dictator dealt death. Other works in the exhibition carry through this atmosphere of dread: rolls of Middle Eastern carpets look like piles of flesh (<em>Skin</em>), a spray-canned shadow of a heroic statue is cast on a baked yellow brick background (<em>Statue)</em>, and pillars of fire burn in the desert (<em>The Fountain</em>).</p>
<p>Sami’s memories of the old country are showcased most obviously in <em>Abu Ghraib</em>, when the iconic photo of the tortured prisoner in crucifix pose (a <a href="/howard-newport">repeated motif for artists these days</a>) is rendered abstract by a mix of acrylic paints and spray can, reduced to a single shape, that somehow is immediately recognisable due to the infamy of the source material.</p>
<p>All in all, an intensely unsettling exhibition.</p>
