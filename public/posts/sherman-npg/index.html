    <h1>Cindy Sherman | National Portrait Gallery</h1>

    <p>This is a <a href="https://www.npg.org.uk/whatson/cindy-sherman/exhibition/">retrospective in the truest sense</a>, ranging from the American master photographer’s first ever book, produced at the age of nine, to some of the most recent uber-glossy, expensively-produced photos of the artist as a range of grandes dames. (She  <a href="http://artangled.com/2018/06/17/sherman-spruth-magers/">showed a few of them at a highly enjoyable show at Sprüth Magers last year</a>.)</p>
<p>It’s not possible <em>not</em> to read meanings into the childhood <em>Cindy Book</em>, which features family snaps, each with the artist herself carefully circled, and a single phrase: “that’s me”. This total self-focus has guided Sherman’s whole career: her student work, her breakout <em>Untitled Film Stills</em>, her hilarious <em>Cover Girls</em> series, the dark experiments with fantasy, latex and masks of the 90s, and her move into luxe and fashion in the 21st century.</p>
<p><img src="/sherman-npg-1.jpg" alt="cover girl"></p>
<p>The budget gets bigger as the years go on, but Sherman keeps her ingenuity, her vim, and her spark. One of the best rooms - stiff competition in this show - is a reproduction of her studio. Which is exactly as you’d expect, an Aladdin’s cave of masks, prosthetics and trinkets.</p>
<p>Such a vast breadth, such a range of expression from a single subject (herself) is Sherman’s achievement, above and beyond the individual works. Usually untitled and carefully numbered, there are about 500 photos in her oeuvre. To call her a “selfie queen”, as the BBC and others have done in reviews of this exhibition, is true but highly reductive.</p>
<p>I’m going to pick out <em>Cover Girl</em>, as the National Portrait Gallery has bought all five of the series together since the first time they were shown, in the late 70s. Each shot is a triptych: the original female-fronted magazine cover on the left, Sherman’s best impression of said cover girl in the middle, and the artist’s vampy mockery of the same on the right.</p>
<p>It’s all there: the chameleonic shape-shifter, the daffy humour, the sly undertow - just <em>what</em> is behind that wink? I adored this room of cover girls, and this show as a whole. I hope she makes it to 1,000 photos.</p>
<p><em>Cindy Sherman is at National Portrait Gallery (London). June 27 - September 15 2019</em></p>
