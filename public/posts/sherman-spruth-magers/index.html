    <h1>Cindy Sherman | Sprüth Magers</h1>

    <p>&ldquo;Get away from me dear, I don&rsquo;t need you anymore!&rdquo; So said silent screen queen Norma Talmadge to a hopeful autograph seeker, just after she made it to the A-list. Well, according to Hollywood apochrypa anyway. The 20s movie grande dame is the latest visual inspiration from iconic shape-shifting photographer Cindy Sherman, whose new work <a href="http://spruethmagers.com/exhibitions/475">in this show at Sprüth Magers</a> is just as funny, off-kilter and subversive as ever.</p>
<p>Her uncanny chameleonic qualities are just as strong as ever. The original selfie queen - actually, that&rsquo;s an insult, more like selfie goddess - Sherman&rsquo;s been trying on one persona after the other for decades. One surreal &lsquo;group shot&rsquo; at this show, featuring four Shermans, hair lacquered and pouting with pussy-bow lips, posing against a lake, really made me double take. Only the freckled shoulders, and a little expression around the eyes, made me realise these four women are all the same person.</p>
<p><img src="/sherman-spruth-magers.jpg" alt="Installation view"></p>
<p>The exagerrated moues, over the top dresses and furs, and brutally pencilled-in eyebrows show that Sherman is going for camp laughs this time around. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cindysherman/?hl=en">Her Instagram is similarly playful these days</a> - and is extra-funny for her recent crusade against other users impersonating her and inviting others to pose for a photoshoot. I hope nobody fell for it, considering, as she angrily pointed out, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even work with models!&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to the show notes, this new work is created through &ldquo;dye stabilisation&rdquo;, meaning there is no need for any protective glass on the photographs. The surface is still glossy and shiny, though. So you can&rsquo;t really see much up close. And, then again, Sherman&rsquo;s haughty gaze(s) aren&rsquo;t exactly welcoming. Get away from me, dear!</p>
<p><em>Cindy Sherman is at Sprüth Magers (London). 5 June - 1 September 2018.</em></p>
