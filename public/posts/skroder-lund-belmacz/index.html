    <h1>Morten Skrøder Lund - ome | Belmacz</h1>

    <p>Philip Larkin, in a rare fit of lyricism, wrote a lovely poem called &lsquo;The Trees&rsquo;. <em>The trees are bursting into leaf / Like something almost being said</em>, it begins. His words come to my mind a lot at this time of year: when winter turns to spring, the weather warms and moistens, the future beckons.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also mentioned in the accompanying notes to <a href="http://www.belmacz.com/gallery/past/morten_skroder_lund">this small show</a>, written by art historian Ben Street. (Annoyingly I can&rsquo;t find them online.) Skrøder Lund&rsquo;s paintings are left untitled. Each loosely-worked painting seems to be hovering at that precise in-between state, between a bare branch and a leafy branch, or between what&rsquo;s said and what&rsquo;s left unsaid.</p>
<p><img src="/skroder-lund-belmacz.jpg" alt="Installation view"></p>
<p>Several of the canvases have ragged, unfinished-looking edges. Some are figurative, some aren&rsquo;t, some are somewhere inbetween. My favourites were next to each other: a pair of lovely lilac landscapes and a serene red-haired Pre Raphaelite girl, lying on the grass. The show notes reveal that the artist often works his pictures up from discarded photos, taking the forgotten into the present day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marks of the brush, in his paintings, are always almost something,&rdquo; Street adds. &ldquo;They are thoughts about things just before they harden into words.&rdquo; And then turned into a physical object: an (almost) rectangular canvas on the wall of a small, snobby London gallery.</p>
<p>Larkin himself was careful to emphasise the physical presence of his trees, those &ldquo;unresting castles&rdquo;, on their way to &ldquo;fullgrown thickness&rdquo;. He freighted their strong trunks and wide, lush branches, with the simple human emotion of hope: <em>Last year is gone, they seem to say, / Begin afresh, afresh, afresh.</em></p>
<p>I found Skrøder Lund&rsquo;s beautiful paintings similarly hopeful, and similarly moving.</p>
