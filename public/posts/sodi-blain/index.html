    <h1>Bosco Sodi - Heavens and the Earth | Blain Southern</h1>

    <p>There are two parts of <a href="https://www.blainsouthern.com/exhibitions/bosco-sodi-heavens-and-the-earth">this exhibition</a>. First the heavens: big black and white paintings, made of ultra-thick paint, cracked in interesting ways, depicting mysterious swirls and bubbles. It’s as if you’re staring at a mountain range from the sky.</p>
<p>Then the earth, brick towers in Jenga-style patterns. They look about as stable as Jenga towers, too: the bricks wonky and uneven.</p>
<p><img src="/sodi-blain-1.jpg" alt="installation view"></p>
<p>The bricks and the paint were both formed by chance as well as craft. Sodi, who lives and works in Mexico, lets his works change with age: his paint cracking as it dries, left out to the elements, his bricks hand-fired, unique.</p>
<p>“It’s about embracing the accident… embracing the passing of time,” the artist says.</p>
<p>Though, ironically, given their quite chaotic genesis, the overall effect of these works is one of great, calming serenity.</p>
<p><em>Bosco Sodi: Heavens and the Earth is at Blain Southern (London).  30 January – 23 March 2019</em></p>
