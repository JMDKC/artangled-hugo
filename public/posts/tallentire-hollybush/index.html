    <h1>Anne Tallentire - As Happens | Hollybush Gardens</h1>

    <p>The works in <a href="http://hollybushgardens.co.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/0052_Hollybush-Gardens_Issue-8_Digital_3.pdf">this small exhibition</a> are grouped around the idea of scale - measurements. In the main room, Anne Tallentire shows us <em>Area</em>, wall-mounted, flat-coloured MDF panels corresponding to the dimensions, rather than the appearance, of objects in the communal area of a public housing complex in Graz: the work was first shown in that city in 2018.</p>
<p>Originally shown, in other words, before the pandemic which has made us measure things in new ways. On the train on my way to the show, I kept a paranoid eye on my fellow passengers in case they got too close. I then walked through an abandoned City of London, kept company mainly by warning signs mentioning the government advice two keep two metres away from each other, if possible.</p>
<p><img src="/tallentire-hollybush-1.jpg" alt="installation view"></p>
<p>In the show notes, the artist says: “<em>Area</em> speaks to the experience of people living in close proximity in crowded housing… Recent social distancing rules means we are all beginning to manage a specific measurement as a parameter of and for life… architecture will now have to rethink what separation means for the new social distancing environment.”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Tallentire’s art doesn’t call to mind such lofty thoughts - to this viewer at least. She used deliberately humble materials, with Arte povera a stated influence. But simply having things measure the same as objects in a crowded housing estate does not lend very naturally to thoughts about the social processes that forced this crowding-in. Let alone our more recent COVID-induced injunctions to stay apart, if we can. Because the art isn’t much to look at, the viewer needs to engage with the ideas behind the art.</p>
<p>Tallentire based <em>Area</em> around social housing, but the exhibition features another series that&rsquo;s on a smaller scale. Along one wall, there&rsquo;s a series of collages of floor plans, layered with post its and coloured blocks which partially obscure the plans’ measurements.</p>
<p>Maybe I wasn’t supposed to, but given that the notes said some of these collages depicted Tallentire’s own home, I couldn’t help but wonder if <em>hers</em> was the one with the five metre by 13 metre roof terrace? Social distancing is easier for some than for others. Or then again, maybe that’s her point!</p>
<p>Tallentire plans to update <em>Area</em> in response to the crisis. I wonder how.</p>
