    <h1>Cynthia Talmadge - Four Courtroom Outfits of Anna Delvey | Soft Opening</h1>

    <p>I read the <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2018/05/how-anna-delvey-tricked-new-york.html">original New York Magazine exposé of Anna Delvey</a>, the mysteriously-accented genius grifter, in bed one Saturday morning, phone a couple of inches from my riveted eyes, too fascinated to even reach over to my bedside table for my glasses.</p>
<p>While that was fun for a morning read, plus a few days of Twitter hilarity, I have to say I’m surprised that Delvey’s impact on the culture means she’s now the subject of a London exhibition viewed by thousands of people a day. That headline number’s a (not quite Delvey-level) trick though, as the gallery’s <a href="http://www.softopening.london/">Soft Opening</a>, the vitrine just inside one of the eastern exits of Piccadilly Circus tube station that I’ve <a href="http://artangled.com/2018/09/16/delmar-soft/">featured previously on this site</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/talmadge-soft-1.jpg" alt="installation view"></p>
<p>Despite the show’s title, its artist, Cynthia Talmadge, was inspired by a lot more than Delvey’s eye-catching court appearances. Fans of the original article will spot a matchbook from the Moroccan resort hotel that forms a key setpiece for one of the larger scams. Elsewhere, there’s a shopping bag, a courthouse building and a pair of theatrical masks: accessories of a deception. The wooden screen onto which these blue designs are painted seems like just another way of obscuring things.</p>
<p>Though despite my repeated visits (as a regular commuter) I’ve missed what apparently is <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/anna-delvey-soho-grifter-becomes-art-world-muse-in-new-installation-about-courtroom-fashion-12">the main action</a> in the exhibition: every now and then a Delvey outfit is mechanically whipped in front of the screen, then back again.</p>
<p>Though seeing this exhibition <em>did</em> inspire me to revisit that jawdropping original article, so I’m pretty happy. A bit happier than Delvey too - despite her fame, which extends beyond this show and to an <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/a29667668/anna-delvey-tv-series-shonda-rhimes-news-cast-date-spoilers/">upcoming Netflix series</a>, she was convicted of attempted grand larceny, among other charges, earlier this year and is currently in prison.</p>
