    <h1>Tokyo: Art &amp; Photography | Ashmolean</h1>

    <p>This is a <a href="https://www.ashmolean.org/tokyo#/">baggy, overly stretched show with some outstanding artworks</a>. It’s aimed at representing the “creative, dynamic and thrilling” Japanese capital, across hundreds of years of history. A tough brief, but I longed for a bit of focus: one single cabinet contained a samurai sword, a tea set, a pair of Noh masks and a lacquered screen. That cavalcade of national symbols ended up making the show look a bit provincial, ironically enough.</p>
<p>The Ashmolean has an incredible permanent collection of 19th century Japanese woodcuts: several of the classic Hiroshige prints of views of Mount Fuji are on show here, looking gorgeously hand-made and irregular under the spotlights. And there are some fascinating more contemporary views of the same city in the same tradition: I loved a set from Yamaguchi Akira featuring the iconic red and white striped Tokyo Tower.</p>
<p><img src="/tokyo-ashmolean-1.jpeg" alt="Tokyo Rumando - Rest 3000~ Stay 5000"></p>
<p>Around half way through, there’s a really great series of black and white photos from Tokyo Romando. Part of the <em>Rest 3000~ Stay 5000~</em> project, the artist visited several “love hotels” in the city, and photographed herself in various provocative poses.</p>
<p>As the title of the project suggests, these hotels are rarely booked for the night: historically, they were used by couples looking for an escape from family life, but of course they’re also used by hookers and their johns. There are a bunch of outstandingly tasteless interiors, revealed in their tired griminess by Rumando’s pitiless eye.</p>
<p>Clad in heels and a basque, sipping some beer from the minibar or sprawled on synthetic fabric sheets, she looks serene and contemptuous. It’s a sharp, deep stab at a very specific subset of urban life.</p>
<p>Actually, that’s a lesson the Ashmolean curators could have learned. There are a lot more styles, eras and movements in the remainder of the show’s three rooms - actually, far too much for the exhibition to be coherent. How much more powerful it would have been with those woodcuts, or those incredible Love Hotel scenes, as the  centrepiece.</p>
<p>Whatever - I’ll remember those black and white photos.</p>
<p><em>Tokyo: Art &amp; Photography is at Ashmolean (Oxford). 29 July 2021 - 03 January 2022</em></p>
