    <h1>Top 5 of 2018</h1>

    <p>It’s been a pretty big first year of art watching for this little side project.</p>
<p>In all, I saw 256 shows and collections in 2018 - not counting repeated visits to some old favourite permanent collections in London. Over that time, I featured a fifth of that total on the site, posting each week.</p>
<p>While I give my eyes a rest over the festive period, here&rsquo;s a round-up post, listing my top five of the year. In the original spirit of the website, these five stand out for the associations they triggered and the vividness with which I remember them. It’s not necessarily about their artistic or curatorial merit. Instead, these are the shows that led to the most connections.</p>
<p>Also, alongside these five wonderful gifts, I’ve picked out a couple of lumps of coal: public gallery shows I really didn’t like.</p>
<h3 id="picasso-1932-love-fame-tragedy-tate-modern-london">Picasso 1932: Love, Fame, Tragedy (Tate Modern, London)</h3>
<p><img src="/picasso-tate.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I was <a href="http://artangled.com/2018/04/08/picasso-tate/">very primed to be snooty about this one</a>, collecting works from a year flushed with love for Picasso’s new mistress, Marie-Thérèse Walter. But in the end I was overwhelmed by the sheer megawatt star power on show, and the variety of the works - from the nudes of Marie-Thérèse to sculpture to drawings inspired by Grünewald’s crucifixions, to Brassaï’s atmospheric photos of Picasso’s country retreat. An unarguable highlight.</p>
<h3 id="sanya-kantarovsky-disease-of-the-eyes-kunsthalle-basel">Sanya Kantarovsky: Disease of the Eyes (Kunsthalle, Basel)</h3>
<p><img src="/kantarovsky-kunsthalle.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This was the new name of the year to me, a <a href="http://artangled.com/2018/09/23/kantarovsky-kunsthalle/">fascinating and totally distinctive painter</a> with a big set of influences, ranging from Mikhail Bulgakov to Grant Wood. This impressive exhibition of new work show that Kantarovsky’s clearly a major talent. Simultaneously lush, creepy and funny, I hope I get to see some more of his paintings in London soon.</p>
<h3 id="the-minds-eye-the-photographs-of-derek-parfit-narrative-projects-london">The Mind’s Eye: The Photographs of Derek Parfit (Narrative Projects, London)</h3>
<p><img src="/parfit-narrative.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Derek Parfit was an Oxford philosopher and amateur photographer. Though “amateur” gives the wrong impression about these obsessively carefully composed and haunting photographs of Oxford, St Petersburg and Venice - which were <a href="http://artangled.com/2018/06/10/parfit-narrative/">on show in the early summer</a>. Parfit visited the latter two cities each year for decades, producing just over 100 finished works, aided by extensive - and expensive - post-production.</p>
<h3 id="my-name-is-lettie-eggsyrub-gloucester-road-tube-station-london">my name is lettie eggsyrub (Gloucester Road tube station, London)</h3>
<p><img src="/eggysrub-gloucester.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Maybe the single art work <a href="http://artangled.com/2018/07/21/eggysrub-gloucester/">that gave me the most smiles over the year</a>, as a frequent commuter through Gloucester Road station. This zany installation by Heather Phillipson takes over an entire disused platform - and, while the artist says it’s a comment on egg torture and death, it’s also funny. It’s got a lot grimier since I reviewed it over the summer, but I’m still glad it’s going to remain there until next June.</p>
<h3 id="soufiane-ababri-haunted-lives-praz-delavallade-paris">Soufiane Ababri: Haunted Lives (Praz-Delavallade, Paris)</h3>
<p><img src="/ababri-praz.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>One great thing about visiting art shows is the way it makes you think about  other exhibitions you’ve seen before. In a trip to Paris, I was a bit overwhelmed and chilled by the Louvre’s enormous Delacroix retrospective, with its sexily docile Arab ladies - and found <a href="http://artangled.com/2018/05/27/ababri-praz/">Ababri’s carefree, cheerful drawings of Arab men</a> at home and at play a refreshing antidote.</p>
<h3 id="disappointments-of-the-year">Disappointments of the year</h3>
<p>Usually, I try to feature shows that I liked on the website - probably <a href="http://artangled.com/2018/07/28/bul-hayward/">Lee Bul at Hayward Gallery</a> was the only headliner that I was disappointed by. And even then, I liked most of the works on show, but just had questions about the curation - especially the decision to put a seriously underwhelming light show in the final gallery, and cram many of Bul’s fascinating cybernetic sculptures in the first. The non-featured show that disappointed me most was Balthus at Fondation Beyeler - what a fraud!</p>
<h3 id="other-highlights">Other highlights</h3>
<p>I don’t want to end 2018 on a bad note, so here are some shows that didn’t quite make the top five, but I want to shout out anyway:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://artangled.com/2018/02/04/dorazio-tornabuoni/">Piero Dorazio at Tornabuoni Art (London)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://artangled.com/2018/11/25/dhollander-victoriamiro/">Ilse D’Hollander at Victoria Miro (London)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://artangled.com/2018/11/18/kubin-lenbachhaus/">Alfred Kubin at Lenbachhaus (Munich)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://artangled.com/2018/06/30/ault-ashmoleon/">America’s Cool Modernism at Ashmoleon (Oxford)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://artangled.com/2018/04/01/laing-levy-gorvy/">Source &amp; Stimulus at Lévy Gorvy (London)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://artangled.com/2018/02/25/gursky-hayward/">Andreas Gursky at Hayward (London)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://artangled.com/2018/05/20/leavitt-elbaz/">William Leavitt at Frank Elbaz (Paris)</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don’t have many extra plans for 2019: certainly I hope to travel more, and also in London break out of my Mayfair habit - convenience trumping all. But I definitely want to keep this little site going. Even if it’s a very personal pleasure, it’s a pleasure nonetheless.</p>
