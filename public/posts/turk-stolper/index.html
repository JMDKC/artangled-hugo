    <h1>Gavin Turk - White Van Man | Paul Stolper</h1>

    <p>I saw this exhibition, <a href="http://www.paulstolper.com/artists/portfolio/200-gavin-turk-transit-disasters-2018">subtitled &lsquo;A Brexit portfolio and other Transit Disasters&rsquo;</a> at a time when the thoroughly depressing Brexit negotiations were reaching something of a climax.</p>
<p>The central motif of the various silkscreen prints is a burnt out Ford Transit. Any British observer would recognise the cultural signifier of a white van - home to &ldquo;White Van Man&rdquo;, a highly Brexity demographic.</p>
<p><img src="/turk-stolper.jpeg" alt="Installation view"></p>
<p>The prints themselves owe an obvious debt to Warhol&rsquo;s gloomy 60s prints of car crashes. Though their surface is sprinkled with diamond dusk, a signature of Turk&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>I always really loved the Warhol prints, along with his spectacularly sinister silkscreens of electric chairs. Turk&rsquo;s tribute is deliberately more hum-drum and low-stakes; a few of the prints show impassive onlookers walking past the burnt-out vehicle without even looking at it.</p>
<p>Transit vans like these, the (excellent) show notes point out, are driven by men who deliver goods &ldquo;in a post high street Britain where global logistics have become intertwined with his paranoid fear of being taken advantage of by bureaucrats and by migrating foreigners&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The eerie pre-crash atmosphere of the present day in London lifts and animates this show.</p>

<p>This week I also checked out <a href="https://www.alminerech.com/exhibitions/5137-a-new-spirit-then-a-new-spirit-now-1981-2018">A New Spirit Then, A New Spirit Now</a> at Almine Rech, a tribute to the RA&rsquo;s classic <em>A New Spirit in Painting</em> show, featuring a welcome work from my beloved AR Penck. I&rsquo;m still baffled by Georg Baselitz&rsquo;s crude, inverted portraits, and <a href="https://www.ropac.net/exhibition/a-focus-on-the-1980s-1">A Focus on the 80s, his show at Thaddeus Ropac</a> didn&rsquo;t help.</p>
<p>Joan Jonas&rsquo;s fey and daffy <a href="https://amandawilkinsongallery.com/exhibitions/112/overview/">In the Trees II video installation</a> is on at Amanda Wilkinson, and I enjoyed her delicate bird paintings. I was totally baffled by <a href="http://arcadiamissa.com/maggie-lee/">Maggie Lee: Music Videos</a> at Arcadia Missa, though to be honest I always love walking up that grotty timewarp Soho staircase to the gallery.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.levygorvy.com/exhibitions/lord-duveen-my-pictures-never-look-so-marvellous-as-when-you-are-here/">Lord Duveen tribute show at Lévy Gorvy</a> was a balls-out blockbuster even by that flashy place&rsquo;s standards, pairing mid 20th century furniture with A-list artworks - a Klein sponge here, a Calder mobile there.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, I saw Sean Scully&rsquo;s calming oil on aluminium horizontal band paintings - such a luxurious sheen! - <a href="https://www.blainsouthern.com/exhibitions/sean-scully-uninsideout/">at Blain Southern</a>, and Tatiana Trouvé&rsquo;s Navigation Map installation at <a href="http://www.kamelmennour.com/media/10764/tatiana-trouve-prepared-space-navigation-map-london-2018.html">Kamel Mennour</a>.</p>
<p><em>Gavin Turk: White Van Man - A Brexit portfolio and other Transit Disasters is at Paul Stolper (London). 20 September - 20 October 2018</em></p>
