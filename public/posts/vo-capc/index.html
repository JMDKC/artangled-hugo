    <h1>Danh Vo | CAPC</h1>

    <p>Sometimes an artist meets a space and both sides lift their game a little. That was the case, for me at least, when looking at Viethamese-born, German-trained artist Danh Vo&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.capc-bordeaux.fr/en/program/danh-vo">takeover of the main hall of CAPC</a> in Bordeaux. This former storage warehouse, in previous decades filled with the spoils of empire, now hosts a site-specific installation from the descendents of an imperial subject.</p>
<p>The huge space is dominated by big blocks of Ferrara marble: the very raw material beloved by Pope-impressing Renaissance sculptors (can you think of one in particular?) To hammer home the point, framed photos of various Michelangelo hands - David, a Medici - are mounted on the rough blocks.</p>
<p><img src="/vo-capc.jpg" alt="Installation view"></p>
<p>Clearly, Vo is interested in the inchoate state, the &lsquo;before&rsquo; stage, or maybe what&rsquo;s natural rather than man-made. This is underlined by other exhibits in the hall: a strip of industrial metal shelving, loaded with artefacts, and a mirrored room which gives visitors a highly unenjoyable view of themselves under harsh overhead lighting.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s an extension of Vo&rsquo;s point. The blocks of marble are the most beautiful things; the human, and the works of humanity, have rather more variable results.</p>
