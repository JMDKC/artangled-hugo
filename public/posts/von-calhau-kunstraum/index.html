    <h1>Von Calhau! MANCHA NEGRA VOLTA A ATACAR | Kunstraum</h1>

    <p>Von Calhau! is a collective project of two artists from Porto, who mainly work with sound and video. <a href="http://kunstraum.org.uk/">This show</a> was inspired by a 1980s-era Lisbon graffiti tag: in English, &ldquo;Black Blob Back to Attack&rdquo;. The tag, in turn, was inspired by a Disney character, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_Blot">the Phantom Blot</a>, one of Mickey Mouse&rsquo;s many enemies. Anyway, that character, which originally appeared in a 1930s comic strip, doesn&rsquo;t really resemble the strange black vinyl inflatable, literally a black blob, filling most of a dingy room off Old Street, pulsing slowly, its seams gaffa-taped and its ends stuck to vents in the floor.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s solid yet gaseous. A bit more surreal than scary, despite the evil red eyes projected onto the ceiling, and the monsterish growls playing in a loop and filling the room. Much more black blob than phantom blot!</p>
<p>The pair don&rsquo;t have much of an online presence: a deliberate choice on the part of the artists, apparently. Not even an Instagram account, guys? So typically Portuguese to act too cool for the internet, anyway.</p>
<p>Back at the Kunstraum, there are a few other works on paper tacked to the wall: a strategically blacked-out Disney comic strip, which shows the interesting variety of Portuguese language onomatopeia (&ldquo;Tomp!&rdquo; &ldquo;Ufa!&rdquo; &ldquo;Uóóóóóóóóóóó!&rdquo; &ldquo;Ih, Ih!&rdquo;). And lastly, a photo of the graffiti tag itself.</p>
<p><em>Von Calhau! MANCHA NEGRA VOLTA A ATACAR is at Kunstraum (London). 12 January - 10 February 2018.</em></p>
