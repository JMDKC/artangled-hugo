    <h1>Jeff Wall | White Cube</h1>

    <p>Jeff Wall’s best known for large, lush, elaborately staged photographs set in light boxes. This <a href="https://whitecube.com/exhibitions/exhibition/Jeff_Wall_White_Cube_Masons_Yard_2022">absorbing exhibition</a> puts on show several of his unstaged and landscape works - all of which are blown up to a grand scale. The show’s at the large White Cube gallery in Mayfair was eerily deserted when I visited, with most other commercial galleries closed due to the Jubilee weekend.</p>
<p>Quite appropriately, the standout exhibit depicts a party - though not one you’d want to be at. It’s called <em>Event</em>, from 2020, and depicts two men in a heated argument. Both are in tuxedos. One leans forward, jabbing his finger into the other’s chest. The other leans back, passively, but with an unreadable expression. Perhaps with a flicker of contempt in his downcast eyes.</p>
<p><img src="/wall-white-cube-1.jpeg" alt="Jeff Wall - &amp;lsquo;Event&amp;rsquo;"></p>
<p>I don’t know where it was taken - my best guess is Los Angeles, where the Canadian artist now lives and works. I don’t know the occasion: at a guess, a wedding? Maybe from the city’s big (and wealthy) Persian community? I don’t even know if the picture was staged or unstaged: if the latter, Wall got spectacularly lucky with the composition and lighting, so of course I suspect the former.</p>
<p>The documentary details are fascinating: the scuffed wood, the garish carpet, the tacky gilt doorframes. The slightly too-big jacket on the smaller man. The sheen of their carefully-polished leather shoes. Just like Wall’s contemporary Andreas Gursky, <a href="https://whitecube.com/exhibitions/exhibition/andreas_gursky_white_cube_bermondsey_2022">on show at another White Cube gallery across town</a>, the subject of the work is rendered all the more noticeable, the more epic, the more dramatic, by the large scale: the print is 2.2 metres tall.</p>
<p>No lightbox needed this time - the human drama illuminates this captured moment. A great artist.</p>
<p><em>Jeff Wall is at White Cube (London). April 27 - June 25 2022</em></p>
