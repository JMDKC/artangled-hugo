      <description>The last exhibition I went to in this place, a Brutalist former office building next to King’s College, featured an ankle-aching 20+ video artists in a programme curated by the New Museum.
This time, the edit is a lot tighter, helped as ever by 180 Strand’s creative partners The Vinyl Factory, with assistance from Paris’ Fondation Cartier. Just three immersive works are on show.
My favourite was Vanishing Point, pictured above.</description>
