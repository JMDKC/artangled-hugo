      <description>This exhibition does not over exert itself in explaining what its various food-themed paintings, sculptures, cartoons and installations may mean. Instead, the curators sensibly concentrate on spectacle, leaving the symbolic meanings of the food on display lightly touched-on or implicit. Happily, this means the show is perfectly pitched to those viewers who feel a bit over-bloated from the festive blowout.
Here’s an example of what I mean: Joris van Son’s Still-life with a lobster, which is in the museum’s permanent collection, and is the centrepiece of the exhibition.</description>
