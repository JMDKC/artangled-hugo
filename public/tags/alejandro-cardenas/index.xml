      <description>Another year, another 50 or so new posts about some art show I&amp;rsquo;d seen that week. Following the pandemic, which put a major dampener on the Artangled project, things are pretty much back to normal on here.
That’s reflected by the numbers. I saw 220 exhibitions in total this past year, practically the same as 2019 (221) and well up from last year’s 141 - a drop almost entirely attributable to lockdowns.</description>

      <description>Chilean artist Alejandro Cardenas based the works in this exhibition around a story in Homer’s Odyssey. He owes some artistic debts to Rousseau, in his frequent use of lush, verdant backdrops, and to de Chirico in the quietude of his pictorial atmospheres, as well as his perspectival clarity.
Odysseus took seven years out from his… well, odyssey, by having fun with the nymph Calypso on her private island. An extremely kind host, she gave him food (and other sensual pleasures), and even provided the tools to build his boat to escape with when he missed his wife too much to stay.</description>
