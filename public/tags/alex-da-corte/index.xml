      <description>It’s not quite Hallowe’en, but there are plenty of anticipation-building creepy thrills to be had at this show , curated by writer, curator and horror movie obsessive Charlie Fox.
Everywhere you look, there’s work blurring the lines between scary, funny and… a bit deviant. From Sam McKinnis’ reverent paintings of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, to a pink laser show from Matt Copson, to some truly disgusting - even by his standards - Larry Clark photos.</description>

      <description>What an impressive last few months at Josh Lilley! Tucked away on a quiet corner in Fitzrovia, just next to the old Middlesex Hospital site - and its bonkers neo-Byzantine chapel, that I&amp;rsquo;m tempted to write a whole separate post about - this little gallery is on a tear.
Late last year came a knockout show from Philadelphia-based Alex Da Corte. And now, it&amp;rsquo;s a group show of sculpture, using mainly found objects, with the descriptive title &amp;lsquo;I Had the Landscape in My Arms&amp;rsquo;.</description>
