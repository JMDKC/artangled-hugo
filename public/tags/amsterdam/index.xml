      <description>Pieter Saenraedam was famous in his lifetime - as he is now - for his paintings of church interiors, which was a whole genre by itself in the Dutch Golden Age. His work stands out for its serenity and calm, and his great skill in dealing with endless shades of white.
White stands for spiritual purity. His bare, unadorned spaces are the results of violent social upheaval: Saenraedam painted Romanesque and Gothic churches, built centuries before for the then-all-powerful Catholic church.</description>

      <description>Talk about star power! Not since Etre moderne, a “best of MoMA” show that took over the Fondation Louis Vuitton in late 2017 while the iconic New York museum was being renovated, have I experienced such concentrated artistic fame in a standalone exhibition.
The concept is simple: a pair of Spanish and Dutch 17th century masterworks, thematically linked, are placed side by side on each wall, in a kind of Godzilla vs Mothra of Baroque mastery.</description>
