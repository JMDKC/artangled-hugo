      <description>Quite suitably, this mini-exhibition of works is in a place of transit: a busy connecting room within the maze of permanent collection displays at Tate Modern. Crowds of wandering friend groups, mostly tourists, march past, without much of a glance at the display. One of the few who stopped to look while I was there, a pair of young English men, were loudly derisive.
I get the derision: at first glance, the collection&amp;rsquo;s impressively banal.</description>

      <title>Jeff Wall | White Cube</title>

      <description>Jeff Wall’s best known for large, lush, elaborately staged photographs set in light boxes. This absorbing exhibition puts on show several of his unstaged and landscape works - all of which are blown up to a grand scale. The show’s at the large White Cube gallery in Mayfair was eerily deserted when I visited, with most other commercial galleries closed due to the Jubilee weekend.
Quite appropriately, the standout exhibit depicts a party - though not one you’d want to be at.</description>

      <title>Yves Marchand &amp; Romain Meffre: Movie Theaters | Tristan Hoare Gallery</title>

      <description>‘Ruin porn’ is a loaded term. Viewers living in intact and tidy homes, getting a vicarious thrill from images of spectacularly derelict places. Places we don’t have to deal with in our day to day lives.
Anyway, if ruin porn is a thing, Yves Marchand and Romain Meffre are some of the top pornographers in the game. They’re behind The Ruins of Detroit, a coffee table book of sumptuously shot photos of the motor city, once so prosperous and now run so completely to seed.</description>

      <title>Candida Höfer - Showing and Seeing | Ben Brown Fine Arts</title>

      <description>Like her Düsseldorf school colleague Andreas Gursky, who I’ve written about on here before, Candida Höfer specialises in large-format photographs of big, man-made spaces. But Höfer’s subject matter has a tighter focus: very fancy, richly-coloured, and almost entirely depopulated, interiors.
The nine photographs on show right now at Ben Brown Fine Arts stick rigidly to her precisely-defined parameters (Höfer has been photographing interiors since 1979). Her empty spaces are built to host crowds of strangers: libraries, in Austria, France and Mexico; and theatres, in Russia and Italy.</description>

      <title>Living with Buildings - Health &amp; Architecture | Wellcome Collection</title>

      <description>What an interesting series of free exhibitions at this totally unique institution on the Euston Road. This latest one is probably my favourite so far - even beating the show last year about teeth. It’s a rag-bag of architectural plans, paintings, maquettes, pages from books - all organised around the theme of buildings that promote health.
To give a couple of examples that stood out to me: a beautiful 70s plan of Milton Keynes (that was the future, once), a Pissarro landscape of Bedford Park in Chiswick - the first garden suburb of all, where the artist lived for a time - and Andreas Gursky’s Montparnasse tower block photo, that I first encountered at the Hayward last year.</description>

      <title>Zoe Leonard. Aerials | Hauser &amp; Wirth</title>
      <link>http://example.org/posts/leonard-hauser-wirth/</link>

      <description>Zoe Leonard is an American conceptual artist who took aerial photos of New York City over several years in the late 80s. Gelatin silver prints of these are on show as Hauser &amp;amp; Wirth right now, and when I went to see them, I basically wanted to buy them all, in an alternative fantasy universe where I actually have the funds to do that.
The artist’s eye gets caught on urban infrastructure; the densely gridded street pattern of the city; worn summer baseball fields, packed back to back and encroached on by houses from all sides; and, most lovingly shot of all, a gleaming rail interchange, the iron and wood of the parallel tracks caught by low light, rendered mysterious by the silver print’s blur.</description>

      <description>An early high point in Andreas Gursky&amp;rsquo;s wonderful show, currently on at the Hayward Gallery, is a photo called &amp;lsquo;Schiphol&amp;rsquo;.
This early-ish (1994) work, looking out onto the runways of the titular airport, was taken at a time of transition for the artist. Gursky was increasingly turning to digital photography, and to the &amp;ldquo;aggregate states&amp;rdquo; for which he&amp;rsquo;s most famous today: complex, heavily retouched depictions of late capitalist workplaces, landscapes and cityscapes.</description>
