      <description>AR Penck has been on show pretty frequently in London over recent years: I enjoyed an intimate collection of his paintings and sculpture at Michael Werner last November, and now some large canvases are at the large White Cube gallery in Mayfair. His popularity isnâ€™t surprising. Penck, who died in 2017, was a loveable artist, with his large canvases of hieroglyph-like figures and symbols.
The large scale of the White Cube gallery gives his works some room to breathe.</description>

      <description>I saw this exhibition, subtitled &amp;lsquo;A Brexit portfolio and other Transit Disasters&amp;rsquo; at a time when the thoroughly depressing Brexit negotiations were reaching something of a climax.
The central motif of the various silkscreen prints is a burnt out Ford Transit. Any British observer would recognise the cultural signifier of a white van - home to &amp;ldquo;White Van Man&amp;rdquo;, a highly Brexity demographic.
The prints themselves owe an obvious debt to Warhol&amp;rsquo;s gloomy 60s prints of car crashes.</description>
