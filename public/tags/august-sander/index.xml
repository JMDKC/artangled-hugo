      <description>Nazi Germany wasn&amp;rsquo;t exactly an ideal environment for any artist, and that&amp;rsquo;s particularly true for an artist with a vision as profoundly kind, non-judgmental and humanistic as August Sander. His life&amp;rsquo;s work was a photographic project called &amp;ldquo;People of the 20th Century&amp;rdquo;, in which he chose as diverse a range of subjects as possible, and took their portraits.
This impressive show at Hauser &amp;amp; Wirth showcases examples from between 1910 and 1931, a year before Hitler&amp;rsquo;s (elected) rise to power.</description>
