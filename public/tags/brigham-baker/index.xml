      <description>I canâ€™t find much about the Zurich-based artist Brigham Baker on the internet, beyond a nice Instagram account. But when I emptied my mind and allowed some gallery memories to drift in (aka, the start of composing one of these lockdown posts), I thought about his beehives.
I saw them at Kunsthaus Baselland, as part of Beehave, a group show celebrating the honeybee - which was a lot less cutesy than it sounds, considering many of the artists used the animal as a symbolic harbinger of climate change, war and so on.</description>
