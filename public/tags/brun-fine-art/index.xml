      <description>This exhibition begins with a surprising painting, considering its painter: a smiling self-portrait. Surprising, as Mario Sironiâ€™s reputation is based his unremittingly grim work, spanning the early 1920s to the 50s. This general bleakness, coupled with his enthusiastic embrace of the Mussolini regime pre-war, and his post-war withdrawal from the public sphere, has made him a pretty obscure name - especially in the UK, where this is the first Sironi show in memory.</description>
