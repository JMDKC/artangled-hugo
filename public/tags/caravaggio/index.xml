      <description>Pieter Saenredam’s paintings of bracingly plain church interiors helped to define the Dutch Golden Age, artistically at least. Saenredam was a master of minimalism, taking infinite care with slightly varied shades of white on his walls, rendering the play of sunlight and shadow.
Michael Craig-Martin’s also known for his use of colour, though his palette is hard, flat and bold. In this exhibition of new works, Craig-Martin committed the (self-described) “sacrilege” of recreating Saenredam’s Interior of the Sint-Odulphskerk in Assendelft as a line drawing, then printing it in several different colourways, including this ultimate inversion - one in black.</description>

      <description>Despite their sudden and enormous impact on the art world over recent months, the ins and outs of NFTs have passed me by. This show is the first of its type I’ve been to - in which the artworks are digital files, authenticated on the blockchain. I can’t face attempting to explain what the blockchain is, because I’ve read several Wikipedia pages and I’m still not sure I understand it myself!</description>
