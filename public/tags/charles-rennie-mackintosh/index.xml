      <description>Across 2019, I saw 221 art exhibitions and collections, not counting repeats, and posted reviews of 48 of them on this website. That’s slightly down on the 256 I saw in 2018. But, on the plus side, I did a lot of travelling within the UK this year and managed to make the site a bit less London-centric,	posting reviews across 10 cities, up from nine last year.
As will hopefully become an annual tradition here at Artangled, I’m going to round up my five favourite shows of the year, and name and shame a couple of public gallery exhibitions I didn’t like so much.</description>

      <description>I’m somebody whose only prior knowledge of Charles Rennie Mackintosh was a font and a fire, prior to attending this show. So, wandering the galleries, I found it all simply revelatory.
While the notes claim the Scottish polymath as the “father of Modernism”, which seems steep, the works on show at the Walker Art Gallery do a great job at lining Mackintosh up in a heritage extending across the continent to Symbolism and the Secession.</description>
