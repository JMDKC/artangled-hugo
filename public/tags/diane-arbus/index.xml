      <description>After the weirdly-curated Lee Bul show here last year, I was wondering what funny treatment the renovated Hayward Gallery would give this iconic photographer. But itâ€™s very well put together, with the small black and white work arranged, seemingly randomly, against white posts in strict grid formation; based, apparently, on the New York streets on which Diane Arbus found some of her most memorable scenes.
The exhibition concentrates on the early career, being mainly made up of photos shot on 35mm between 1956 and 1962.</description>
