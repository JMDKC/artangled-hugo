      <description>It’s hard to theme an exhibition around a concept. If the concept’s too broad, the effect is absurd; too specific, and it could just be hair-splittingly academic and boring. But this very smartly-conceived and executed show finds the sweet spot, featuring works which all feature some form of imprint. A concept sufficiently rich in suggestion, and encompassing a sufficiently broad variety of artistic expression, to make this exhibition really special.</description>

      <description>I can&amp;rsquo;t shake the sneaking suspicion that Ed Ruscha&amp;rsquo;s partly to blame for the inspirational quote pictures that are a solid building block of so many Instagram accounts these days. Which is maybe a bit unfair, but at least pays tribute to the range of his influence.
It&amp;rsquo;s his works on paper, including sketches and a variety of books he&amp;rsquo;s published over the decades, that are the focus of this show.</description>
