      <description>This exhibition claims to show the only work Giorgio Morandi ever painted from a commission. Still Life (Musical Instruments), from 1941 and pictured below, is definitely a break from the norm for the artist, who was and remains famous for his oddly intense small paintings of collections of bottles and cups.
It isn&amp;rsquo;t surprising that this artist wasn&amp;rsquo;t receptive to commissions. Beyond his fame, Morandi stands out for the dogged narrowness of his focus, and his life.</description>

      <description>Mario Sironi was a poet of the grimy and growing suburbs of Milan. In the inter-war years, he made a series of small, thickly worked &amp;lsquo;Urban Landscapes&amp;rsquo;, close-cropped, bleak city scenes of factories, smokestacks and apartment blocks.
There are two really fine examples in the Estorick&amp;rsquo;s latest show, subtitled &amp;lsquo;Modern Works from the Pinacoteca di Brera&amp;rsquo;. This is the first time many of these paintings and sculptures, donated by collectors Emilio and Maria Jesi, have been shown outside of Italy.</description>
