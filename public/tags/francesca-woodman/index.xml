      <description>During her short and very prolific working life, Francesca Woodman left an indelible impression. As an art photographer, she made around 10,000 negatives and 800 prints, and defined an entire aesthetic as she found posthumous fame during the 1980s. She favoured black and white, long exposures which distorted and elongated her body; dishevelled, empty rooms with bare floorboards; props that emphasised her usually naked body.
She&amp;rsquo;s paired with Egon Schiele in this exhibition at Tate Liverpool.</description>
