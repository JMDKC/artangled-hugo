      <description>London’s Garden Museum is a lovely, peaceful enclave on the Southwark riverfront, adjoining Lambeth Palace. A nice contrast to the subject of its latest exhibition, who’s one of the very angriest artists of the last few decades: Derek Jarman.
Alongside his work as a filmmaker and painter, specialising in naked guys speaking Latin and cludgy black canvases studded with broken glass respectively, Jarman cultivated a famous garden. For the last five years of his life, he lived at Prospect Cottage, close to the nuclear power station in Dungeness.</description>
