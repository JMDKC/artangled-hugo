      <description>Richard Patterson was a YBA, part of the scandalous 1990s ‘Sensation’ generation. But, like his peers Gillian Wearing and Gavin Turk, he’s matured into a painter of sensitivity and skill. Proof of this view comes in ‘Only Fans’, a show of small-format works using what the press release describes as a “carnal palette”, which closed this week at Timothy Taylor.
All 13 paintings in the exhibition are dreamy swirls of flesh-toned roses and ochres, on luxurious-looking linen canvas.</description>

      <title>Gavin Turk - White Van Man | Paul Stolper</title>

      <description>I saw this exhibition, subtitled &amp;lsquo;A Brexit portfolio and other Transit Disasters&amp;rsquo; at a time when the thoroughly depressing Brexit negotiations were reaching something of a climax.
The central motif of the various silkscreen prints is a burnt out Ford Transit. Any British observer would recognise the cultural signifier of a white van - home to &amp;ldquo;White Van Man&amp;rdquo;, a highly Brexity demographic.
The prints themselves owe an obvious debt to Warhol&amp;rsquo;s gloomy 60s prints of car crashes.</description>
