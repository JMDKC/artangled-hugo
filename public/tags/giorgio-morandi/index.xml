      <description>This exhibition claims to show the only work Giorgio Morandi ever painted from a commission. Still Life (Musical Instruments), from 1941 and pictured below, is definitely a break from the norm for the artist, who was and remains famous for his oddly intense small paintings of collections of bottles and cups.
It isn&amp;rsquo;t surprising that this artist wasn&amp;rsquo;t receptive to commissions. Beyond his fame, Morandi stands out for the dogged narrowness of his focus, and his life.</description>

      <title>José Lerma: Guerras Tibias | Almine Rech</title>

      <description>José Lerma’s striking recent paintings, several of which are on show downstairs at Almine Rech at the moment, are both austere and abundant. Austere in their extreme economy of huge brushstrokes, but abundant in the sheer quantity of paint used to make them. The artist achieves this effect by using a commercial broom to apply acrylic paint directly to a rough burlap canvas.
The head of each subject, most of which are captured in profile, fills each frame almost exactly.</description>

      <title>Antonio Calderara: From Lake Orta | Lisson Gallery</title>

      <description>Antonio Calderara, also known as Antonio da Vaciago, lived quietly next to Lake Orta in northern Italy. Born in 1903, he was active from the 1920s, right up to his death in 1978. According to this collection of works, at Lisson Gallery, he specialised in small, jewel-like figurative works on wooden panels early on, eventually moving to almost-abstraction by the end. All his work is linked by a sense of quietude and withholding: quite appropriate for an artist who’s dropped into semi-obscurity.</description>

      <title>Junque | Massimo de Carlo</title>

      <description>The first time I saw US-based Jamian Juliano-Villani’s work was at Massimo de Carlo last year. I wrote about this show’s prime attraction: a cuddly tiger getting rigorously orally penetrated with a plastic-clad dildo. The fun continues in the same gallery this summer, in a group show organised around “junk”.
That’s junk in both the literal and slang senses of the word: either worthless clutter, or, like… a penis. It doesn’t really matter which way you take it (hmmm), Juliano Villani’s slapdash, don’t-care aesthetic isn’t proscriptive in the least.</description>

      <description>Mario Sironi was a poet of the grimy and growing suburbs of Milan. In the inter-war years, he made a series of small, thickly worked &amp;lsquo;Urban Landscapes&amp;rsquo;, close-cropped, bleak city scenes of factories, smokestacks and apartment blocks.
There are two really fine examples in the Estorick&amp;rsquo;s latest show, subtitled &amp;lsquo;Modern Works from the Pinacoteca di Brera&amp;rsquo;. This is the first time many of these paintings and sculptures, donated by collectors Emilio and Maria Jesi, have been shown outside of Italy.</description>
