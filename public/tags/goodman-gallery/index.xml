      <description>An example, for this viewer at least, of unintended consequences between an artwork’s intention and its effect. Alfredo Jaar’s exhibition is a sober document of one of the most horrific events of the last century: the sectarian violence that swept Rwanda in 1994, leaving over a million dead. Thes events unfolded, he argues, without the blanket coverage from an outraged global media they warranted.
To illustrate his point, he’s lined up a row of front covers for Newsweek, which 25 years ago was one of the most-read news weeklies in the world.</description>
