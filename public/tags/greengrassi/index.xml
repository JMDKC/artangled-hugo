      <description>Roe Ethridge, an American photographer, spent the early part of 2021 in Paris, as the city started to shrug off the hideous toll of COVID, and started to reopen. The French capital had a tough time of it by European standards, both in its case rate and the strictness of the restrictions faced by citizens, including a nighttime curfew.
There’s something of that mood in the pose of an old lady who caught the photographer’s eye one day, and is featured in this show, on currently at Greengrassi.</description>
