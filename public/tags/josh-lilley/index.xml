      <description>I chucked out a rotten half lemon the same morning I saw this show. There was nothing pretty about it, the yellow skin turned wobbly, the innards blue black: fruit spoils so quickly in the summer heat. Kathleen Ryan, on the other hand, sees beauty in this kind of organic ruin; she assembles semi precious gemstones, studded with metal, into sculptures of mouldy fruits, and produces something unique and strange.</description>

      <description>This is definitely the first gallery exhibition I&amp;rsquo;ve been to that&amp;rsquo;s named after a 90s kid&amp;rsquo;s TV show. (If you don&amp;rsquo;t remember the essential after-school viewing for now-thirtysomethings &amp;lsquo;Fun House&amp;rsquo; with Pat Sharp, this video should help you out.) But there&amp;rsquo;s not much to tie that &amp;ldquo;messy technicolour treat for kids&amp;rdquo;, as the show notes have it, to this rather sober collection. It&amp;rsquo;s a group show, and the artist in it that most stood out for me is American photographer Genevieve Gaignard, who I&amp;rsquo;d spotted at a previous exhibition at Stephen Friedman, and read about in this (excellent) New Yorker profile.</description>

      <description>What an impressive last few months at Josh Lilley! Tucked away on a quiet corner in Fitzrovia, just next to the old Middlesex Hospital site - and its bonkers neo-Byzantine chapel, that I&amp;rsquo;m tempted to write a whole separate post about - this little gallery is on a tear.
Late last year came a knockout show from Philadelphia-based Alex Da Corte. And now, it&amp;rsquo;s a group show of sculpture, using mainly found objects, with the descriptive title &amp;lsquo;I Had the Landscape in My Arms&amp;rsquo;.</description>
