      <description>This artist is the subject of much critical sniffiness, thanks to his works generally being so open and people pleasing. His vinyl cuts and sculptures adorn many a public square (and the odd album cover), to general acclaim. His current show at Lisson Galleryâ€™s Mayfair outpost is typically cute and arresting.
There are two main subjects, generally in painted metal: group scenes of crowds walking down the street, and brightly-coloured tower blocks.</description>
