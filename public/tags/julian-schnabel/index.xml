      <description>This American artist, who lived past 100, has a hefty reputation as a Surrealist icon of the 20th century. Over her long career, Dorothea Tanning was famous for her crafty paintings and stuffed-toy-like sculptures. Accompanied by her husband Max Ernst, she lived in an Arizona desert town and then in Paris. Thatâ€™s certainly the life on show in her Tate Modern retrospective, which I enjoyed and returned to repeatedly during its run early last year.</description>
