      <description>Kerry James Marshall is uber-influential these days, with his works selling for seven figure sums - to P Diddy, no less. He&amp;rsquo;s also an incredible and sensitive portraitist. Sometimes beloved, successful work is great work, as his new exhibition at David Zwirner proves. But the show also has interesting things to say about the nature of that success.
This is an exhibition about the ways in which paintings can be made, and the contexts in which they are received.</description>
