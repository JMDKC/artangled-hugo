      <description>Itâ€™s been a pretty big first year of art watching for this little side project.
In all, I saw 256 shows and collections in 2018 - not counting repeated visits to some old favourite permanent collections in London. Over that time, I featured a fifth of that total on the site, posting each week.
While I give my eyes a rest over the festive period, here&amp;rsquo;s a round-up post, listing my top five of the year.</description>

      <description>This Russia-born, New York based artist likes to do his work prone on the ground, with people around to talk to. Stray brush strokes and other little mistakes are usually left in the final painting, to better build up its texture. He mixes oil paint and water, which don&amp;rsquo;t really mix properly. But, despite these quite zany and antic working methods, the subjects of Sanya Kantarovsky&amp;rsquo;s paintings and prints are relentlessly despairing.</description>
