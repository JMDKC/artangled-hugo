      <description>Gerhard Richter made a series of oil paintings based on photographs in the 1960s. They&amp;rsquo;re among his most famous works, which is quite an achievement, considering his is a career of both extreme achievement and length. One of the finest is Motorboot (Motor Boat), from 1965, in the permanent collection at the Kunstmuseum in Basel.
The artist used source material ranging from popular magazines to his own family photo albums. He painted them at a time of an economic boom, with Germany (the West, at least), aiming to leave behind the dark past and enjoy a brighter life of travel, new leisure pursuits and an ever-increasing range of consumer goods to buy.</description>
