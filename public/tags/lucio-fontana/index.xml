      <description>Antonio Calderara, also known as Antonio da Vaciago, lived quietly next to Lake Orta in northern Italy. Born in 1903, he was active from the 1920s, right up to his death in 1978. According to this collection of works, at Lisson Gallery, he specialised in small, jewel-like figurative works on wooden panels early on, eventually moving to almost-abstraction by the end. All his work is linked by a sense of quietude and withholding: quite appropriate for an artist who’s dropped into semi-obscurity.</description>

      <description>I had a cringeworthy encounter with an in-house camera crew when I visited the HangerBicocca in Milan a few years ago. On stepping into the enormous space, I was confronted with one of mid-century maestro Lucio Fontana’s neon Ambienti, hanging, glowing blue, from the ceiling. What do you think of Fontana, the crew asked me, on the lookout for some promo content. I nervously mumbled something about not seeing him often in London.</description>

      <title>Jan Henderikse - MINT | Cortesi</title>

      <description>One man&amp;rsquo;s trash is another&amp;rsquo;s treasure. That&amp;rsquo;s a message taken on board by so many artists over the past century, with everyone from Duchamp to Jannis Kounellis to Michael Landy using everyday detritus in new ways. Jan Henderikse, currently showing at Cortesi, takes things to new, daffy heights.
Most of the works are framed, wall mounted, and neatly unified by theme. There are collections of coins, number plates, toilet soap, corks and plastic caps.</description>
