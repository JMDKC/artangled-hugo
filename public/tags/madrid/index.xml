      <description>Maybe it’s bad taste, maybe it’s cliché to use this artist for a pandemic-inspired post. Egon Schiele is one of the most famous victims of the 1919 Spanish Flu outbreak, dying aged 28, three days after his pregnant wife. While he’s best-known for his tormented, electrically-hued, sinewy nudes, Schiele left a considerable legacy in landscape painting, too.
How many new town scenes would he have painted, had the flu not cut him down?</description>
