      <description>This portrait photographer shoots well-off, good-looking young people. Her subjects tend to pose for the camera, natural and relaxed expressions on their unlined faces. Most of the photographs at Rineka Dijkstra’s current London show keep to this formula: there’s a series of sibling portraits, brothers and sisters pictured at home. These homes are generally well-appointed, even fancy.
But the photo below shakes up the formula a bit, and stands out. It was taken in Sefton Park in Liverpool, part of Dijkstra’s Park Portraits series, which includes works from between 2003 and 2006.</description>

      <title>Nan Goldin - Sirens | Marian Goodman Gallery</title>

      <description>This is Nan Goldin’s first London solo show in almost 20 years, and it’s really drawing the crowds. The exhibition begins with one of the US photographer’s trademark digital slideshows, The Other Side, a compilation of 25 years of candid snaps of her friends on society’s margins. The next room features some of the stills from which she sourced the slideshow.
Her subjects, showgirls, drag queens and groupies, have plaquey teeth, smoke a lot of cigarettes and are photogenically skinny.</description>

      <title>Ilse d’Hollander | Victoria Miro</title>

      <description>Ilse d’Hollander worked in Flanders, and had just one gallery show, in a local café, before her death in 1997. She painted alone, in a studio in the countryside. And now, she has a UK solo show, on at Victoria Miro right now.
You could call all of the paintings on show “landscapes” of one kind or another. Houses, trees, grass and sky are mainly legible, though sometimes unusually cropped and zoomed in - and therefore abstracted.</description>
