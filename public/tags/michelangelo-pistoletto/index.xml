      <description>Kerry James Marshall is uber-influential these days, with his works selling for seven figure sums - to P Diddy, no less. He&amp;rsquo;s also an incredible and sensitive portraitist. Sometimes beloved, successful work is great work, as his new exhibition at David Zwirner proves. But the show also has interesting things to say about the nature of that success.
This is an exhibition about the ways in which paintings can be made, and the contexts in which they are received.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s OK to be a one-trick pony, if the trick&amp;rsquo;s good enough. Michelangelo Pistoletto is associated with the arte povera movement of Italy in the 1960s, and is famous for his &amp;lsquo;mirror paintings&amp;rsquo;, large wall-mounted mirrors with painted or printed images on them. The first mirror painting dates from the early 60s. And Pistoletto is still at it, judging by this show, currently at Simon Lee Gallery.
The dimensions of the mirrors haven&amp;rsquo;t changed much over the decades.</description>
