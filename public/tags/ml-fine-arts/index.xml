      <description>This intoxicating exhibition gives us a panoramic view of a photographer who specialised in narrow, close-cropped scenes.
Luigi Ghirriâ€™s photographs showcase his background as a surveyor, his daily dealings with charts and maps. The exhibition concentrates on his work during the 70s, a time of comparative peace and stability in Italy, his native land, following lean postwar years. Gardens and houses are neat, the roads are smooth, the skies are (usually) blue.</description>
