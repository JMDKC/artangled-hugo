      <description>When I first saw Denzil Forrester’s paintings, at an exhibition at Stephen Friedman last May, I did what I usually do when I see an artist’s work for the first time: try to think of what - or who - it reminds me of. The connection I made in my head with Forrester was with the Italian photographer Massimo Vitali. Maybe not the most obvious kinship, but both artists have a love of the crowd - party scenes packed with people looking their best.</description>
