      <description>I found this show spectacular but a bit inscrutable. It’s summed up - though maybe not in the way the curator, Kenneth Baker, intended - by the artist’s own quote from the show notes: “When you are confronted with the work of art, either you feel that it is it, or it leaves you soulless.”
On entering the Mazzoleni gallery, behind one of Mayfair’s less functional doorbells and beyond one of its less populated front desks, I was confronted by the spectacular in search of a soul: Avvoltoio, meaning ‘vulture’, a new work, free-standing and grand, made out of burnt wood.</description>
