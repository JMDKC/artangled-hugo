      <description>Another year, another 50 or so new posts about some art show I&amp;rsquo;d seen that week. Following the pandemic, which put a major dampener on the Artangled project, things are pretty much back to normal on here.
That’s reflected by the numbers. I saw 220 exhibitions in total this past year, practically the same as 2019 (221) and well up from last year’s 141 - a drop almost entirely attributable to lockdowns.</description>

      <title>Théo Mercier: The Sleeping Chapter | Conciergerie</title>

      <description>On a rainy November’s morning in the dead centre of Paris, I experienced a show that can only be described as dreamy.
Théo Mercier is an artist I admire a lot - and have featured on here before. He works in a monumental register, in a humble way. He reflects on the ephemerality of things, the fragility of the present as we lose ourselves, inevitably, to the future.
In the last show of his I saw - in this city in 2017 - Mércier cast Classical-looking amphoras, busts and pillars in thin plaster, and set them at dangerously teetering angles.</description>

      <title>Alejandro Cardenas: CALYPSO | Almine Rech</title>

      <description>Chilean artist Alejandro Cardenas based the works in this exhibition around a story in Homer’s Odyssey. He owes some artistic debts to Rousseau, in his frequent use of lush, verdant backdrops, and to de Chirico in the quietude of his pictorial atmospheres, as well as his perspectival clarity.
Odysseus took seven years out from his… well, odyssey, by having fun with the nymph Calypso on her private island. An extremely kind host, she gave him food (and other sensual pleasures), and even provided the tools to build his boat to escape with when he missed his wife too much to stay.</description>

      <title>Cottagecore | Sultana</title>

      <description>Cottagecore wasn’t a familiar term for me. I enlarged my vocabulary thanks to a group show named after the aesthetic, on at Sultana in Paris when I visited this week.
The word&amp;rsquo;s unfamiliar but it describes a familiar aesthetic. One of city-dwelling young people, shut out of employment gainful enough to buy a cottage of their own, fetishising a pastoral, artisanal lifestyle. It’s characterised by floral motifs, embroidery, pastel colours and everything “cosy”.</description>

      <title>Ilya Repin: Painting the soul of Russia | Petit Palais</title>

      <description>It’s a fleeting moment in time, captured in oil paints some time in 1876. Ilya Repin, fresh out of art school and on a sponsored stay in Paris, spotted a moody young man, leaning on a wall in a back street of Montmartre. The painting ended up in a public collection in Saratov, labelled, simply, этюд (‘Study’). And now it’s back to its city of origin, in a vast retrospective of its painter, in the Petit Palais.</description>

      <title>Christine Safa: L’habitude du ciel | Praz-Delavallade</title>

      <description>Christine Safa&amp;rsquo;s sensitive oil paintings employ a repeated motif that combines landscape and portrait. Her mysterious figures merge and meld with natural features.
Visiting her small exhibition at the Praz-Delevallade gallery towards the end of a long, cold winter’s day in Paris, I found myself moved both by Safa’s pictures and her words. The show notes emphasise the ephemerality of the moments she’s aiming to capture. It’s no surprise that she tends to depict the beginning or end of the day, with its changing orange-and-purple light.</description>

      <title>Interlude - Théo Mercier at Bugada &amp; Cargnel</title>

      <description>Back in lockdown, nowhere to go. Which is a problem for a website that&amp;rsquo;s updated weekly, with updates based on an exhibition I saw that week. During the spring 2020 lockdown here in London, I wrote a bunch of posts about works in permanent collections that I was thinking of at time of writing. This time, during this hopefully short winter interlude of closed galleries, I’m going to dig into my notes, and write each week about a standout show I saw sometime in the past, that didn’t make the website for whatever reason.</description>

      <title>Interlude - Daniel Buren at the Centre Pompidou</title>

      <description>The art industry must be one of the hardest hit in the current pandemic. The buying and selling of works between dealers and buyers depends on personal contact, though I’m sure a lot of sales for investment can be conducted virtually. More gravely, the showing of museum collections for paying visitors is impossible now. Less importantly, travel lockdowns mean that the peripatetic lives of star artists aren’t really doable either.</description>

      <title>Hans Hartung - La fabrique du geste | MAM Paris</title>
      <link>http://example.org/posts/hartung-mam/</link>

      <guid>http://example.org/posts/hartung-mam/</guid>
      <description>This artist hasn’t had a major retrospective in years, but had a career that spanned early 20th-century experiments in Symbolism, via Surrealism. He ended up, wheelchair-bound, firing acrylic paint through a spraygun in an insane burst of productivity, with 360 works in the final year of his life, 1989, alone.
Hartung found fame in the 50s and 60s, though, with his black-ink-on-paper works. These spikes and swoops found their way onto many book covers and student bedroom walls.</description>

      <title>Gabriel de la Mora - Écho | Perrotin</title>
      <link>http://example.org/posts/de-la-mora-perrotin/</link>

      <description>An arresting example of craft and obsession is provided by this Mexican-born artist, on show at Perrotin. De la Mora loves wall-mounted works, created piecemeal with great meticulousness. Their overall effect is weirdly heartening and uplifting.
From a distance, the small, monochrome works, generally layered and repeated across the wall, do not look like much. It’s only when you get closer, when you realise what they’re made from, that the involuntary intake of breath comes.</description>

      <title>Luigi Ghirri - Cartes et Territoires | Jeu de Paume</title>

      <description>This intoxicating exhibition gives us a panoramic view of a photographer who specialised in narrow, close-cropped scenes.
Luigi Ghirri’s photographs showcase his background as a surveyor, his daily dealings with charts and maps. The exhibition concentrates on his work during the 70s, a time of comparative peace and stability in Italy, his native land, following lean postwar years. Gardens and houses are neat, the roads are smooth, the skies are (usually) blue.</description>

      <description>What horrible news, with more coming every day, from Venezuela! Alexander Apóstol, Venezuelan-born and Madrid-based, has a take on his country’s descent into madness in Dramatis Personae, a photo work, showing in Paris right now.
The visitor is confronted with a grid of black and white portraits, each showing a Venezuelan archetype: some timeless, some, very unfortunately, stuck in the here and now. There’s Simon Bolívar, a beauty queen, a rioting student, and a journalist with a shiny black eye.</description>

      <title>Top 5 of 2018</title>

      <description>It’s been a pretty big first year of art watching for this little side project.
In all, I saw 256 shows and collections in 2018 - not counting repeated visits to some old favourite permanent collections in London. Over that time, I featured a fifth of that total on the site, posting each week.
While I give my eyes a rest over the festive period, here&amp;rsquo;s a round-up post, listing my top five of the year.</description>

      <title>Albert Oehlen - Sexe, religion, politique | Max Hetzler &amp; Gagosian</title>
      <link>http://example.org/posts/oehlen-hetzler/</link>

      <guid>http://example.org/posts/oehlen-hetzler/</guid>
      <description>Albert Oehlen is a difficult artist to love, but an easy artist to admire. This is due to his tendency to treat his painting as an intellectual exercise within strict self-imposed boundaries, rather than a vehicle of sensual pleasure. This tendency is on show in a pair of identically- titled exhibitions in two of Paris’ most prestigious private galleries: Max Hetzler and Gagosian.
Each exhibition features works with a near-identical yellow hue: clearly another deliberately-imposed restriction from Oehlen.</description>

      <description>This enormous exhibition stretches across four floors and umpteen galleries at Fondation Louis Vuitton. I toured them at the end of a long day, feet aching. Oh god, there’s more, I muttered, turning into yet another lavishly appointed room crammed with huge, violently-coloured paintings. Then again, maybe this feeling wasn’t entirely down to my aching feet: I felt similarly overwhelmed in Basquiat’s last retrospective, on at the Barbican earlier this year.</description>

      <title>Kupka: Pionnier de l&#39;abstraction | Grand Palais</title>

      <description>The Grand Palais&amp;rsquo; impressive František Kupka retrospective was pretty much empty when I visited late last month. It was probably due to the show being free after 8pm to celebrate some European Union-sponsored &amp;ldquo;night of museums&amp;rdquo;. But, also, František Kupka isn&amp;rsquo;t really an A-lister for either impressionist portraiture or abstraction. Which is a shame, as his is a seriously impressive career, with all its twists and turns, not just from the figurative to the abstract, but from painting into drawings and woodblock prints - and back again.</description>

      <description>This spring, the big show in Paris is a vast Delacroix retrospective at the Louvre, a fittingly lush and lavish tribute to the great Romantic painter. Of course the exhibition includes Delacroix&amp;rsquo;s sexy genre paintings from his stay in North Africa - those shadowy oil paintings of exotic, inscrutable, yet clearly sexually available women. But there&amp;rsquo;s a funny (and much sexier) riposte to all that across town, in a debut exhibition from Tangiers-born Sofiane Ababri.</description>

      <title>Western Movie - William Leavitt | Galerie Frank Elbaz</title>

      <description>Obviously this little website is more of a personal project than an actual news source, but I&amp;rsquo;ve tried not to talk about shows that are actually closed at time of writing! I&amp;rsquo;ll make an exception for this one, though, as it surprised (and haunted) me so much. It&amp;rsquo;s from US artist William Leavitt, who exhibited several small paintings and one video installation at Frank Elbaz in Paris.
I went in the late afternoon yesterday, the final couple of hours of the show.</description>
