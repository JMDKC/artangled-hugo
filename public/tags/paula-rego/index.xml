      <description>Knight Errant (1978), pictured below and currently on show at Timothy Taylor, is a very intense painting, painted at an intensely trying time for its artist. Victor Willing had moved back to London from Portugal with his wife, Paula Rego; by all accounts, theirs was a deeply dysfunctional relationship. Heâ€™d been diagnosed with MS, a condition that would take his life a decade later. He&amp;rsquo;d been painting in a rented studio in Stepney that had no windows.</description>
