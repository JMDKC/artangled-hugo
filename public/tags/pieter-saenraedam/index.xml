      <description>Pieter Saenraedam was famous in his lifetime - as he is now - for his paintings of church interiors, which was a whole genre by itself in the Dutch Golden Age. His work stands out for its serenity and calm, and his great skill in dealing with endless shades of white.
White stands for spiritual purity. His bare, unadorned spaces are the results of violent social upheaval: Saenraedam painted Romanesque and Gothic churches, built centuries before for the then-all-powerful Catholic church.</description>
