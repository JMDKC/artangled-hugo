      <description>Gisela McDaniel’s women tend to wear proud smiles, adopt open and relaxed postures, and stare directly out at the viewer. They’re generally in company, too, sitting and relaxing in pairs and threes. They sit in lush landscapes, surrounded by tropical foliage.
Six of this artist’s paintings are currently on show at Pilar Corrias. The oil paint is embroidered by found objects - beads and fabrics, generally - strategically stuck onto the canvas.</description>

      <description>China&amp;rsquo;s home to one in four people, and many of the world&amp;rsquo;s fastest growing cities. Four different Chinese artists&amp;rsquo; responses to the city are currently on show at Pilar Corrias.
Chen Wei, now resident in Beijing, stood out to me. One lovely photo in particular, New Buildings, (2016), a rainy window, dappled with condensation, lit up with multiple colours, suggesting windows and signage in a street behind.
This weirdly wistful image is a bit of a trick, though.</description>
