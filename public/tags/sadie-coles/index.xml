      <description>Being a woodcarver in Bavaria seems an unlikely apprenticeship for a fine artist, but looking around this show, currently on at Sadie Coles, it all sort of makes sense. Paloma Varga Weisz started woodcarving in a tiny town in the mountains after being rejected from art school the first time round. After getting in at the second try, she began a more formal education in DÃ¼sseldorf, home of a crop of sober, straightforwardly honest artists and photographers of the late 20th century.</description>
