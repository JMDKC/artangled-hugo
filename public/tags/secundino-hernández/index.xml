      <description>This week, I got a lesson in the imaginative handling of paint. The classroom was the beautiful, high-ceilinged main gallery at Victoria Miro in Islington. The teacher was Madrid-based Secundino Hernández. The subject, pictured below, is Minimar (2022): an enormous canvas which, despite its title, captures something cosmically vast. There are several paintings of his on show in this exhibition, but Minimar stood out.
I loved Hernández’s unmannered handling of his acrylic paints.</description>
