      <description>Steph Huang, who was born in Taiwan but now lives and works in London, makes sardonic, surprising, and sometimes funny use of everyday objects. A collection of works are on show at mother’s tankstation: several quite modest individual pieces pack a bigger collective punch when imaginatively displayed, together.
The artist clearly misses home, but finds quirky pleasures in her new surroundings. The ironically named Forest features bamboo leaves, neatly trapped in a gridded metal mesh.</description>
