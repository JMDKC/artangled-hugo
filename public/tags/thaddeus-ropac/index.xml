      <description>Albert Oehlen is a difficult artist to love, but an easy artist to admire. This is due to his tendency to treat his painting as an intellectual exercise within strict self-imposed boundaries, rather than a vehicle of sensual pleasure. This tendency is on show in a pair of identically- titled exhibitions in two of Parisâ€™ most prestigious private galleries: Max Hetzler and Gagosian.
Each exhibition features works with a near-identical yellow hue: clearly another deliberately-imposed restriction from Oehlen.</description>

      <description>This group show in Thaddeus Ropac&amp;rsquo;s very grand London space centres on three women Minimalist artists who worked in the 1970s. The one who stood out to me was Rosemarie Castoro, whose work gave the show its title.
Land of Lads, Land of Lashes refers to two sculptures in the big room on the upper floor. They&amp;rsquo;re made of epoxy, a type of polymer. They&amp;rsquo;re coloured deep black. And they have vaguely organic, even anthropomorphic, form.</description>
