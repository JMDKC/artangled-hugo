      <description>This fascinating and tiny painting, 16cm across and 10cm high, was usually one of my stops when I dropped in to the National Gallery. I must have visited the gallery hundreds of times over the years, and therefore must have seen this painting dozens of times, back when I had the option of doing so.
The title is admirably descriptive: Jones paints, in oils on paper, a worn out wall, lit by strong sunshine.</description>
