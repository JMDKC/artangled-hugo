      <description>Grayson Perry’s been making a multi-media attack on the idea of Englishness over recent years. In 2019, Perry had an exhibition of pots on this theme at Victoria Miro’s Mayfair space in 2019. Most recently, there&amp;rsquo;s this exhibition of textile works, and a TV show called Grayson Perry’s Full English. In both, Perry pokes at, and sometimes celebrates, English people&amp;rsquo;s sense of themselves.
I said the exhibition had &amp;ldquo;textile works&amp;rdquo;, but these particular posh cloths are actually tapestries.</description>

      <description>This week, I got a lesson in the imaginative handling of paint. The classroom was the beautiful, high-ceilinged main gallery at Victoria Miro in Islington. The teacher was Madrid-based Secundino Hernández. The subject, pictured below, is Minimar (2022): an enormous canvas which, despite its title, captures something cosmically vast. There are several paintings of his on show in this exhibition, but Minimar stood out.
I loved Hernández’s unmannered handling of his acrylic paints.</description>

      <title>Ilse d’Hollander | Victoria Miro</title>

      <description>Ilse d’Hollander worked in Flanders, and had just one gallery show, in a local café, before her death in 1997. She painted alone, in a studio in the countryside. And now, she has a UK solo show, on at Victoria Miro right now.
You could call all of the paintings on show “landscapes” of one kind or another. Houses, trees, grass and sky are mainly legible, though sometimes unusually cropped and zoomed in - and therefore abstracted.</description>
