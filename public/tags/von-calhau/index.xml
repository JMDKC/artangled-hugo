      <description>Von Calhau! is a collective project of two artists from Porto, who mainly work with sound and video. This show was inspired by a 1980s-era Lisbon graffiti tag: in English, &amp;ldquo;Black Blob Back to Attack&amp;rdquo;. The tag, in turn, was inspired by a Disney character, the Phantom Blot, one of Mickey Mouse&amp;rsquo;s many enemies. Anyway, that character, which originally appeared in a 1930s comic strip, doesn&amp;rsquo;t really resemble the strange black vinyl inflatable, literally a black blob, filling most of a dingy room off Old Street, pulsing slowly, its seams gaffa-taped and its ends stuck to vents in the floor.</description>
