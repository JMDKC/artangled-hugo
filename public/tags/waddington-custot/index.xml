      <description>A pair of unseasonal exhibitions this week, in galleries on opposite sides of Cork Street. Unseasonal in that both of the featured artists use bare, skeletal tree branches as consistent visual motifs; look around you though, and trees are bursting into leaf everywhere, as summer begins to stir.
Victoria Crowe, on show at Flowers, studied under Prunella Clough, who’s shown up more than once on this site before; unlike her teacher though, Crowe’s work escapes from the city.</description>

      <description>Three linked exhibitions this week, each carrying with them a whiff of patchouli oil and pot. It’s not quite (yet) a Summer of Love in London, but these shows all reach back to the 1960s, a time of Pop and Op&amp;hellip; and some very big floppy collars.
One of the biggest and floppiest is sported by legendary fashion designer Ossie Clark, sketched at home by the still more legendary (and decade-defining) David Hockney.</description>

      <title>Alice Anderson - Body Disruptions | Waddington Custot</title>

      <description>Alice Anderson is known as a performance artist as well as a visual artist, but this show is definitely big on the visual wow factor. Dominating the larger gallery at Waddington Custot are a series of copper-wire-covered monoliths. Anderson calls them Body Disruptions, and they’re built by wrapping the wire around a rectilinear wooden structure so that it forms repetitive motifs and patterns.
As an artist, Anderson’s very interested in digital connectivity, and of course copper wire’s a transfer medium for online information.</description>

      <title>Modern Masters  | Hamilton&#39;s</title>

      <description>So often when looking at large-scale work, it&amp;rsquo;s a single detail that catches your eye. With Modern Masters, a group photographic show currently on at Hamilton&amp;rsquo;s, it&amp;rsquo;s a young woman commuter in a light raincoat, glaring out from a train. She&amp;rsquo;s the emotional centre of Shinjuku Station, Tokyo, Japan, taken by photographer Hiro in 1962.
Across the breadth of this seven metre wide work, made up of seven gelatin silver prints, faces and hands of Tokyo commuters are pressed against the steamy glass of the subway car&amp;rsquo;s window.</description>
