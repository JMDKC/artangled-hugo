      <description>I love the Wellcome Collection! Not only does it host the best museum shop in London hands down, its exhibitions are so entertaining - imaginative grab bags of interesting things, based loosely around a single theme. I also feel a bit defensive of it as an institution, given the silly &amp;ldquo;anti-woke&amp;rdquo; media fracas it faced recently when it announced plans to update its permanent collection display.
Anyway, following recent shows on themes like electricity, games and (my favourite) teeth, it’s the turn of sight.</description>

      <description>What an interesting series of free exhibitions at this totally unique institution on the Euston Road. This latest one is probably my favourite so far - even beating the show last year about teeth. It’s a rag-bag of architectural plans, paintings, maquettes, pages from books - all organised around the theme of buildings that promote health.
To give a couple of examples that stood out to me: a beautiful 70s plan of Milton Keynes (that was the future, once), a Pissarro landscape of Bedford Park in Chiswick - the first garden suburb of all, where the artist lived for a time - and Andreas Gursky’s Montparnasse tower block photo, that I first encountered at the Hayward last year.</description>
