      <description>The Royal Academy has been pretty conservative with its COVID response, tightening capacity by 80% and making pre-booking compulsory for everyone, members included. It seems tighter than Tate (whose Bruce Nauman show, which I also visited this week, was pretty full). Or maybe itâ€™s the nature of its Summer Exhibition, delayed by lockdown, with over 1,000 works crowding the walls of the main galleries, that makes the relative paucity of the crowds stand out still more.</description>
